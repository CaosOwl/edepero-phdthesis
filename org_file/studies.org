  One of the responsable of the Geant4 hadron team emailed the following suggestions:
  - reccomended version of Geant4 is 10.5.p01, we were using 10.5 and the differences
    should not be big.
  - charge exchange is typically not used, and the one implemented is still too crude to be used
    also is typically relevant only at low energies
  - we are interested in the projectile and target difraction, typically switched off if the target 
    has more than 10 Nucleons, but our active part could make a difference.
  - Elastic scattering might also play a role, one could try to check different treatment.
    - Try out *QGSP_FTFP_BERT* to use QGS for hadron with energy larger than 25 GeV
    - Use *FTFP_BERT_TRV* to use alternative treatment
      of hadron elastic scattering
    - Rerun *FTFP_BERT* by modifying the file in geant4/source/processes/hadronic/models/parton_string/diffraction/src/
      called G4FTFParameters.cc
      - switch off completely (for all types of target nucleus) projectile diffraction and target diffraction
      - switch on (for all types of target nucleus) projectile diffraction (while leaving off target diffraction)
      - switch on target diffraction diffraction and off projectile diffraction
      - switch on both projectile diffraction and target diffraction

* Disagreement between data and MC for hadron <2019-06-24 Mon>
  A disagreement was observed between data and MC for all hadron calibration run observed.
  specifically the number of events where the hadron deposit all its energy in the ECAL/WCAL
  is strongly overestimated in MC (almost two order of magnitude). 
  
  an example can be found [[/home/deppy/polybox/PhD/org_files/run_May_2018/plots/hadron_comparison/ecal_hadrons_comp.pdf][here]] using simulation and data from 2018 visible mode setup.
** characteristic
   - effect is stronger for pions, stronger for kaons. almost non existent for antiprotons (mass scaling? conservation of baryon number plays a role?)
   - effect stronger with higher radiation length (larger for ECAL, less for WCAL, good agreement betwenn WCAL for antiprotons). Is it scaling with it?
   - Charge exchance should not play a role (excluded in the simulation). This is effect of standard hadronization (overestimation of pi0?).

     - geometry of the setup
     - *Digitization is performed* page 5.
     - Requirement used for events selection discussed in Sec. 5
     - Additionaly only events for which the hadronic shower start in the first 5 AHCAL layer are used for the analysis (should be good for us)
     - between 40 and 100 GeV data are overestimated (like us) but disagreement is below 6%
     - interaction length (probability of pi- to have perform inelastic scattering) fitted using AHCAL data
     - Very good agreement for FTFP for interaction length of material
     - overall MC overestimate the response

    pi- tested (energy 2-10 GeV) with the SiWCAL of CALICE at FNAL. 350k events are selected
    for the comparison with MC
**** Geant4 comparison
     - largest discrepancy observed in the longitudinal and transverse distributions of reconstructed events
     - event selection mostly ensure MIP or interaction of incoming pi- and reduce mu- contamination
     - physics list used: QGSP_BERT, FTFP_BERT, FTFP_BERT_HP and QBBC
     - *Fig.6*: At high energy all physic list overestimate the interaction fraction by about 7% <====== HINTS
     - Shower energy increases with the energy of the incoming pi- and is on 
       average 15% higer in data than in simulation <====== GOES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
     - Bertini cascade model was observed to generate too wide showers
     - Fritiof model seems to agree better with the data
     - FTFP_BERT_HP should treat low energy neutron well, but gives systematically
       smaller mean and standard deviation compared to FTFP_BERT
     - *Fig. 10* all MC model seems to overestimate mean and standard deviation of hits. <=== HINTS
***** Longitudinal shower distribution
      One of the most relevant for my study, and where the biggest disagreement lies
      - at 10 GeV distribution is best, at 6 GeV peak is overestimated by 4%
      - *Fig.18* shows mean and standard deviation comparison between many physics list
      - Larger mistmatch in 9.6 version of Geant4 compared to 9.3 of longitudinal shower profile
        corrections should be implemented in the new version 10.1

    - Background for the $K^0_S$ is typically parameterized with an *exponential*, for $\Lamba$ a 3rd degree Cherenkov polinomia
    - For fitting the invariant mass following function were tested:
      1. Bifurcated Gaussian for the peak signal
      2. 3rd, 4rd Degree *Chebyshev* polynomial
    - Uncertainty was also calculated by varying a bit the cuts along the region and see the differences

    - *Systematic uncertainty:*
      1. _Hadron loss_: requires track match with the TOF hits
      2. _Reconstruction efficiency_: Following criteria were varied to estimate the uncertainty:
         + Minimum number of point measured in the track
         + azimuthal angle
         + impact parameter
      3. _Forward acceptance_
      4. _ToF-F reconstruction_: estimated using a sample of events with very strict selection criteria
         and a conservative value of 50% was assigned.
      5. _Secondary interaction and non-Hyperion feed down correction_
      6. _Hyperion feed-down correcton_
    - *the h- analysis method:* based on the fact that $\pi^-$ are largely dominating the sample. thus PID
      can be skypped and a small correction of non $\pi^-$ can instead be estimated using simulation  [[/home/deppy/polybox/PhD/materials/Kshort/Abgrall2016_Article_MeasurementsOfPiPmΠKPmKK0SKS0V.pdf::20][page20]]
*** Analysis of V events
    [[/home/deppy/polybox/PhD/materials/Kshort/Analysis_Vevents.pdf][link]]
    *Authors:* J. Podolanski & R. Armenteros (1954)
    Useful variable for two body decay are discussed in this article
    - Assumin momenta of decayed particle and their angle has been measured all kinematics can be reconstructed
    - The following is true for the quantities:
      \[

      E_a E_t - p_a p_b cos \phi_{ab} = (m^2_a m^2_b + M^2 p^{*2})^2

      \]
    - Analysis is performed following the three variables
      \[      
      p^* = \frac{1}{2 M} [M^2-(m_1+m_2)^2]^{\frac{1}{2}}[M^2-(m_1-m_2)^2]^{\frac{1}{2}}      
      \alpha^*=\frac{m^2_1-m^2_2}{M^2}
      \epsilon^*=2p^*/M
      \]
      1. $\epsilon^*$ measures the _energy release_. if 0 no energy is released, if 1 the whole invariant mass of the 
         primary is converted in kinetic energy.

      2. $\alpha^*$ represent  the _asymmetry_ of the decay for 0  $m_2 = m_1$ to $\alpha^* = 1 - \epsilon^*$ for $m_2 = 0$

      3. The energy scale is finally calculated when either M or $p^*$ are given

** shower profile
   tried with new analysis on shower profile by taking the fraction of energy deposited. In the ecal cells neighboring
   the central cell (3,3) of the ecal. While results in the simulation seems promising use the same profile on the data
   (run 2363 for electrons and run 2204 for hadron were compared) gives some unpredictable result. For the simulation a cut
   of 0.1 on the chi square was used while one of 1600 for the simulation were the difference were huge. Here some table of efficiency
   and purity:

    as in the simulation. The following cut were applied before collecting the
    profile in order to check a good sample of electrons:
    - entrance angle of the particle less than 5 mrad
    - only 1 cluster in both MM1 and MM4
    - beam spot of 3 cm diameter center in center of central cell of ecal
    - srd cut [1,70] for each srd crystal
    - scintillator timing between [160,225] ns
    - pedestal less than 6 ADC from the mean in each of the cell used (central
      and neighbour cell)

      this profile were used to put a cut of 30 chi square to reject improper
      showe profile.
**** table efficiency run 2363
     this table illustrate the efficiency in different region for run 2363. The additional order of magnitude suppression
     for the post spot in the hadron run is due a misalligment of the beam and does not have a phys

     a second approach was to measure efficiency after all beam purity cut and srd cut were applied. This increase drammatically
     the efficiency. The efficiency for a cut of 20 on the Chi-square was: *94.4* \%

*** chi square comparison simulation-data
    similar approach was used but using the shower profile obtained by the simulation of 100 GeV electrons.
    
**** efficiency in simulation
     a cut of 0.1 in the chi square was used since the shower profile was highly
     idealized a TProfile using the "s" option was used. no resolution added.

     the same cut was also attempted for the dark photons. It was observed a big 
     suppression for electron with less than 20 GeV energy:
     | particle              | E > 20 |   E<20 |

*** comparison at different geant4 cut <2017-05-10 Mit>
    first guess simulation with 10^5 events at 0.001 , 0.01 and 0.1 *mm* cut was performed with wrong results. Second simulation at
    higher statistics with 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 *mm* cut was performed and the result compared with the data. A significant displacement
    of the peak in the central cell 3X3 was found between data and simulation. Next step would be to correct such disagreement manually
    but this will of course destroy the agreement of the spectra since it normally depend of the fraction of the spectra.
    - *The result of a gaussian peak of the cell 3x3 in data run 2363 in the simulation was:

*** investigating optimal choose for bin size in the TProfiles <2017-05-29 Mon>
    the problem of the optimal length of a bin of a TProfile depends on the number of statistcs
    that one wants per bin and the precision that ones want to investigate the distribution.
    The main variable however would be how much precisely the extrapolation of the MM on
    the Ecal. A small montecarlo code was developed to investigate this. the code can be
    found here: [[/home/emilio/polybox/PhD/code/c++/montecarlo/extrapolate_line_err.cc][code]]
    where:
    - z1 :: position of the MicroMegas Nr.3
    - z2 :: position of the MicroMegas Nr.4
    - Ecal_pos :: position of the Ecal
    - errX :: Resolution of the MicroMegas
    - errZ :: error in the position of the detectors
    - DeltaX :: difference in the hit position in the X axis
		
		different values where inputted for the unknown value errZ and DeltaX, ranging from *[1,30] mm* for DeltaX and
		from *[1,5] mm* for errZ, in both cases the error still to be dominated by the pure error in the MicroMegas resolution:
		giving always ~ 0.13 mm as error. for large DeltaX (~ 30 mm) the error of course scales much more with errZ. But it is still
		around the same values as long as errZ is around ~1 mm. Nevertheless in order to have a more stringest statistics the binning
		will be choosen to be a square of width 0.5 mm, that for sure won't exceed the error and will provide a meaningfull statistic.
*** comparison using code in the official reconstruction <2017-06-19 Mon>
    The chi-square computation was applied to calibration run 2363, hadron run 2204 and physical
    run 2441 to test the effect. The same was done using both data-database and MC-database. The
    benchmark cut used was of 2 chi using the data-database and 40 for the simulation database to take
    the shift observed in the chi-square into account. A cut of two was observed when simulation database
    was used on simulation was maximum comparability.

*** third simulation batch <2019-08-07 Wed>
    For Sergei request (see log [[new simulation requested by Sergei]]). Used a more
    manageable bias (1/6 of the entries are signal *TO BE CONFIRMED*). so double of the
    even were simulated i.e. 60000.
    In case of the double calorimeter solution, no correction for the calibration was used.
    An offline calibration will be needed for this.
*** fourth simulation batch <2019-08-09 Fri>
    Sergei proposed another design based on a first active calorimeter part (21X0) and 
    a catcher of 10-15X0 length to strongly reduce the energy detected. Will probably require
    a strong recalibration, also remember that a new veto of 5 mm will be probably used in the new
    search. For now same counter can be used, to be substitute later.
    This means 25 layer of normal calorimeter and 12-18 layer of pure tungsten
    for a resulting 16.1-17.6 cm
    <2019-08-14 Wed> Simulation results are weird and a bit counter intuitive, a second simulation
    was used to reduce the radiation length to exactly the one used in 2018. Result can be found
    in the [[results]]

    In these results the most promising results are summarized and the yield of 
    dark photon for different cut is reported. Day needed to cover the anomaly were calculated
    using the mean value of EOTS collected in 2018. Most relevant entry of the tables are
    the one with *SignalQuality2* since they are the one of most of our analysis.

** log
*** <2019-07-15 Mon>
    all condor job did not progress, make another try using espresso queue to reconsturct some invisible mode
    simulation. after that I should contact CERN support.
    *IMPORTANT <===* first simulation was ended, new simulation are underway <2019-07-15 Mon>
*** <2019-07-16 Tue>
    *WARNING<===* Some problem were found using smaller counter depth, moving it to 1 mm shift the energy deposit on the WCAL
    an additional offline calibration correction need to be applied to fix this. A Gaussian fit is used for the purpose. Exact
    position of the peak was found at 84.86 GeV for 30 layers and 84.76 GeV for 35 Layer. Which lead to a correction of 
    *150. / 84.81 = 1.7687*
*** <2019-07-17 Wed>
    Same problem in calibration was encountered for 1.5 mm counter layer.
    Calibration constant was this time: 150. / 117.8
    *TODO:* make it automatic in the analysis!
*** new simulation requested by Sergei <2019-08-07 Wed>
    After the first studies was sent I received a mail from Sergei. In short the request is to cover 
    espilon to 0.0015 or even 0.002 for safety. The following scenario are credible:
    *IMPORTANT:* energy resolution should remain around 10%.
    *REQUEST:* build ZX position of the dark photon for the energy of 150 GeV
    1. 6 mm of converter and make 20 layer of 6 mm W + 2 mm Sc, check the resolution!
    2. keep the current structure (3mm + 2 mm Sc) for the first 15 X0 and make the rest 20-25 X0 as a e-m tail catcher
       with structure (6 mm W + 2 mm Sc), energy resolution mostly defined in the first 15 X0. (Second part
       would be around 10 layer to comply with Sergei request, for a total of 25 layer)
*** simulation went wrong <2019-08-15 Thu>
    Second batch is weirder, double peak structure can be seen. Talk with Mikhail
    about it. Second simulation with different sigmanorm was sent to see if the problem was that.
* Muon trigger for 2021 muon mod4e                         :muonmode:trigger:
  - Main objective is to design shield to reduce background from  neutrals
    and reduce effectively the trigger down to a manageable amount
  - org buffer can be found [[./Muon_Mode/organization.org][here]]

      - magnet at 3.4 distance from ECAL is sufficient and extremely flexible
      - 1 m distance of trackers reduce back-scattering and do not spoil momentum resolution
      - 90% invariant mass efficiency
      - HCAL and VETO leaking needs to be studied
      - Di-muon acceptance still acceptable
      - realistic vacuum included and does not spoil invariant mass resolution

   - all organization was moved in the org file of the git repository [[/home/deppy/workdir/mm-clustering/README.org][link]]
*** new discussion with sergey <2019-12-16 Mon>
    After short discussion it was decided to assume that the position of the vertex is already
    known. This is a good approximation if we assume the decay length to be very short.
    Also following modification to the setup:
    - 21 m total length can be chosen
    - make larger number of particle that can be registered
    - Use larger magnet strength? Maybe 1.72 Tesla

I'll try to answer your questions below :) But of course we can also organize a Vidyo meeting, e.g. on Wedneday if it's fine with you.

1) concerning the cluster size, there are many ways to reduce it, depending on your setup & required performance. By the way, do you use 1D or 2D readout, with or without resistive films? This indeed has a large impact on the cluster size
- reduction of the drift gap. If you have a comfortable S/N ratio you can afford to reduce it down to a few mm. 
- choice of a gas mixture with good quenching properties (absorb UV photons and limit secondary avalanches) and low transverse diffusion. For the former, isobutane is indeed a good choice, and it can reach high gains. For the latter, CF4 and CO2 are preferable. Probably the best choice in this case is a mixture of isobutane and CF4. We tried but never used Ar-CO2 with our large detectors (D=17), as the maximal gain was not high enough for such multiplexing
- use of high resistivity if you use resistive films. But if you use them with 2D readout, the cluster size can be anyway quite high, particularly with resistive strips
- if you have tracks with large incident angles (probably not your case), what is above has to be balanced: indeed with low transverse diffusion gas and large track angles, one can end up with discontinuous clusters, which in the case of multiplexed detectors is a headache :)

2) concerning the multiplexing pattern: in one group of strips (e.g. 61 for GBar), there are no 2 strips connected to a single channel, by construction. However between 2 groups of strips this will happen, i.e. you will find 2 distant strips connected to the same channel. The minimal distance (let's call it d) between 2 strips connected to the same channel is an important feature of the multiplexing pattern. Indeed, if one has clusters larger than d, then there is some ambiguity in the charge sharing to assign to each physical strip. If one builds the multiplexing pattern by incrementing the modulo 1 by 1, usually d is small (4-5). But by reordering the group (that is, by changing the modulo sequence), you can increase d significantly. In the 61/17 configuration, the order we chose allowed to have d=15. As it is probably said somewhere in the paper, we think that d can be increased up to (n-1/4) for maximal multiplexing, where n is the number of channels. I think it is safer for better separation of close clusters to maximize d in your pattern. I should say we did it empirically, so I don't know if there is a mathematical construction that will give the best ordering...

3) concerning the reconstruction, I think what Balint developed is very smart, the only concern I had (apart from the speed) was the ability to reconstruct discontinuous clusters (e.g. in the case of large track angles or dead strips). What I'm using is a convolution between the strip charge pattern and a moving Gaussian. This works well for our purpose (large angle and practically no double tracks), but probably not in your case. CNN and deep learning in general are certainly the best options, but I'm not an expert at all :) I was thinking some years ago to train a standard NN, but the number of inputs (61) and variable number of outputs (number of tracks and their positions) makes it not adapted to this type of networks.

Cheers,
Sébastien

Dear Sebastien,

My name is Emilio Depero. I am a Ph.D. student working for the NA64 experiment where we employed a Multiplexed Micromegas detector. I think you are already familiar with my predecessor Dipanwita Banerjee and my colleague Gianluca Janka. We are busy with a new project involving Multiplexed detector and we'd like your opinion and your help for a couple of things.

The main goal of this project is to understand how efficiently (and with how much precision) two very close clusters can be separated in a gas detector of this kind and how much we can hope to improve this value. The reason for this is that this feature will be extremely important in the upcoming beam time of NA64. If we can do anything to improve this knowledge it will be invaluable.

Right now we have the following questions:

1) One of the main features that will let us distinguish between two close clusters will be is the width of the cluster itself. We want to reduce it as much as we can and make it more "stable" in a way, the more similar the cluster looks the easier will be the recognize two clusters even when they are overlapping. We are planning to do some testing in our lab with different gasses to see which one turns out to be optimal. 
Probably as a quencher, isobutane might be a good fit, do you have any idea about what other things we could do to achieve this goal? So far we always used (Ar/Co2).

2) Building the multiplexing map properly might also be very relevant to tackle this problem. Currently, We have some problems understanding how exactly the maps are built. We read the original paper where there is an optimal formula to follow in the case of prime number channels. But We also see that neither the NA64 map (64 channels, 5 multiplexing factor and APV readout) or the GBAR (6 channels, 17 multiplexing factor and APV readout)  map are constructed using this formula. We figured that the reason is that in case of large signal the repetition of the cluster starts to be too high very soon. Typically we see that the formula is still used but the s is not incremented by 1 but some corrected factor. How is the factor chosen typically? Do you have any suggestions to build a map that has as aim the distinction of two very close clusters?

3) If you have any suggestions in general about the modeling of the clusters and what kind of algorithm we could use of course we would be glad to hear it. Thankfully we also have real data that we can use coming from the NA64 experiment but we will also need to generalize them for different channels and different gasses. Regarding the algorithm, we are trying the one already developed for the GBAR some time ago where you were also involved plus something else based on neural networks. Please let us know if you have any suggestions!

I realize the mail is quite heavy and maybe the answers to each question are a bit lengthy. I would be glad to organize a meeting on Skype/ Vidyo to discuss this if you are available.
Best regards
Emilio
**** Questions
***** TODO [/] Cluster size and gas
      - [ ] He asked if we use a 1D or 2D readout for MM, we need to answer him
      - [ ] Asked if we use resistive or not resistive film
      - If we have a good S/N we can afford reducing the drift gap to a few cm
      - We need a gas with good quenching property and low transverse diffusion
      - Probably the best is a mixture of Isobutane and CF4
      - Use high resistivity if we resistive films, but cluster can be anyway high
***** TODO [0/0] multiplexing pattern
      - Minimal distance d between neighbouring strip is quite important feature
        - depends from the width of the cluster and should be decided appropriately
        - can be in theory increased to p - 1/4
        - It should be safer for a better separation between cluster to maximized d.
        - It was done empirically, so no hard mathematical structure behind
***** TODO [/] Cluster modeling
      - He is using a a convoilution between strip charge pattern and a moving gaussian
      - He also thinks strips are a good solution

    - [ ] Discuss the reduction of material budget with CERN workshop
    - [X] Understand the number of ADCs needed and ask *Igor Konorov* to produce them

      + Price could be reduced by producing the ADC together with the Bonn group
    - New design for APV are now used, one important point is that the connector will be changed. New Micromegas should be produced with the new connector already installed.
    - For the old Micromegas we will use the old APV (total of 8 are needed, currently ~10 in our possesion) *TO BE CHECKED AT CERN*

***** To cross check with Pol
      - There are no descriptions of MM and GEM chambers used in the discussions of Sec. III
	- Really needed?
      - Add a short description of the hardware trigger used to collect events.
	- Maybe only a reference?
      - deposited larger than 1.5 MIP.  ===> .deposited by the decay e+e- pairs larger than 1.5 MIP.
	- Is it needed? Also to me is not 100% correct
      - Sec. V.C, Fig. 12  and Conclusion. - It would be good to specify the beam intensity, the number of good spills, etc. used in the calculation of the required running time at H4 to get ~ 7 x10^11 EOT.
	- Maybe this is too technical (and I don't very interesting) for the reader. The main message is that we use the same rate observed in 2018, which means the estimate is based on realistic conditions that can be achieved.
*** Article about discouraging protophobic Beryllium anomaly
    - new article cam out saying that such boson is an impossible explanation: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11288.pdf
    - It was requested to underline that we are not model sensitive and other alternative are being explored.
***** previous snippet
It was put forward  \cite{feng1,feng2}, that this anomaly can be interpreted as the emission of a protophobic gauge boson $\dm$ decaying into $\pair$ pairs. To be consistent with the existing constraints, the $\dm$ boson should have a non-universal coupling to quarks and a coupling strength with electrons in the range of $2\times 10^{-4} \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 1.4\times 10^{-3}$ which translates to a lifetime of the order of $10^{-14}\lesssim \tau_X \lesssim 10^{-12}$~s. Remarkably, this model also explains within experimental uncertainty the new result obtained with the $^4$He nucleus, providing both kinematical and dynamical evidence to support this interpretation \cite{feng3}. This model will be used as benchmark for the NA64 current results and to cast the sensitivity of the new setup described in this article. However, other solutions of the $\dm$ anomaly were proposed, see for example \cite{Nam:2019osu, Seto:2016pks}.

Interestingly, such a new boson with a relatively large coupling to charged leptons could also resolve the tension between measured and predicted values of the $(g - 2)_{\mu}$. In addition to vector and axial-vector explanation of the $\dm$ anomaly, one can consider scenarios involving hidden pseudo-scalar boson \cite{Ellwanger:2016wfe}. Corresponding pseudo-scalar couplings to electrons satisfy existing experimental constraints \cite{Andreas:2010ms,Adler:2004hp}. An analysis to probe such pseudo-scalar states at NA64 \cite{Kirpichnikov:2020tcf} would require a proper Monte-Carlo simulation of the spectra and flux of light pseudo-scalar boson produced in the target by electrons.
Another interesting result comes from the new measurement of $\alpha$ performed by Parker et al. \cite{Parker191} which combined with the $(g-2)_e$ measurements results in a 2.4$\sigma$ deviation from the QED predictions \cite{PhysRevLett.100.120801}. Should this tension be confirmed by the planned improvement of Parker's et al. measurements, the two constraints coming from the NA64 results and $(g - 2)_e$ would exclude the vector and axial vector couplings explanation of $\dm$. On the other hand, models with nonzero V$\pm$A coupling constant with the electron would explain both electron and muon $(g - 2)$ anomalies \cite{Krasnikov:2019dgh}. In these models, the $\dm$ could have a coupling of $6.8\cdot 10^{-4} \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 9.6 \cdot 10^{-4}$ which leaves an interesting region of the parameter space to be explored.
These models motivated the study of the phenomenological aspects of such a light vector boson weakly coupled to quarks and leptons (see, e.g., Refs.~\cite{fayet1, fayet2, fayet3, fayet4,jk, cheng, Zhang:2017zap, ia, liang, bart}) 
and new experimental searches (see, e.g., Refs.~\cite{mb, nardi}).

* Reconstruction of energy in ECAL
  In this studies I summarize the energy reconstruction of the ECAL,
  the main source if the [[/home/deppy/PhD/materials/Start materials/COMPASS/Compass_hadron_setup.pdf][COMPASS article]]
** energy calibration
   - Energy calibration derived from an analysis from $\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma \gamma$
   - During final data analysis, additional corrections applied tro the specific data set, namaely diffractive dissociation or Primankoff scattering
   - selected invariant mass within 50 MeV of nominal pi0 mass
   - For each of two showers, a two- dimensional histogram E γ vs (M γγ − M π 0 ) is filled, which is associated with the shower’s central module.
     - The central module is defined as the module which contains the highest fraction of the deposited
     - The values stored in the two-dimensional histograms are used as a starting point for the calibration procedure.
     - Some correction factor are applied (see paper)
   - Usefull photon efficiency can be seen  [[/home/deppy/PhD/materials/Start materials/COMPASS/Compass_hadron_setup.pdf::80][here]]
** Clusters and showers
   - shower assumed to originate from a single particles
   - cluster are shower that overlap
   - Fitting function are based on an empirical cumulative function, as defined in [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168900295007172]]
   - If the energy deposited by a shower is projected onto a transverse axis with the shower center at
   0, the fraction of the total shower energy accumulated between −∞ and a position x on this axis can be
   described by:
   \[
   F(x) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{\pi}\sum a_i \cdot \arctan{\frac{x}{b_i}}
   \]
   - different set of parameters are used for different ECAL modules
** Clustering and shower reconstruction
   - Signals from adijacent modules combined to form a cluster
   - Starting from the first   module not yet used in the cluster, each of the (vertical, horizontal, and diagonal) neighbours is checked  for a measured energy above a threshold of 100 MeV for ECAL1, and of 200 MeV for ECAL2
   - a fit of the shower profiles to the cluster data is performed
     + The fit is first done with a single shower. Further showers are added one by one with a new fit being performed after each added shower.
     + When adding more showers, the module searched is the one with the largest relative discrepancy between its measured energy and the energy predicted to be deposited by all showers √ fitted to the data so far.
     + The centre of the new shower candidate must be located at a distance larger than 2/2 times the module width from the centre of the nearest shower.
     + A difference in energies is also required: the central module of the new shower must contain at least 20% of the energy deposited by all other showers in this module.
   - As several showers might be fitted into the same cluster, the total energy of all showers in the module is given by:
     \[
     E^{pred}_j = \sum e_i \cdot G_j(x_i,y_i)
     \]
   - In addition to the energy, the time information is also used.
     - The time t i of a shower is defined as the mean value of the times of all modules contributing to the shower, weighted with the energy deposited in each module.
   - Minuit fitter used to optimize the shower parameters to maximize likelihood
   - Error on E and t calculated from an energy dependent parameterization determined from data beforehand
     - with this procedure intime shower and pileup events are distinguished

* Magnetic field impact on invariant mass                              :2021:
  how much does uncertainty of the magnetic field impact the reconsturction of the invariant mass?
** Which ballpark we are talking to?
   - If we use this [[./magnetic field/MBPL2S_02 Summary.pdf][document]]
     - The request accuracy seems to be 1%  [[./magnetic field/MBPL2S_02 Summary.pdf::3][link]]
     - From this slide  [[./magnetic field/MBPL2S_02 Summary.pdf::9][slide]] it looks like the precision should be up to 0.1%

** How is the error to be defined?
   - simple smearing due to error propagation? The error is in good approximantion linear.
   - Systematic shift in the magnetic field? If the field is stable but not properly measured the impact could be just a shift
   - Magnetic mapping? if there is a magnetic map, it could be hard to properly defined error (different map with shift?)
** Impact, how to define it?
   - Width of the invariant mass
   - efficiency of the 10% cut?
   - Increase error
