* NA64 collaboration meetings
** <2019-08-09 Fri>
*** Vladimir Poliankov presentation
    - Sergei points out that target is crucial, maybe ECAL can be used for the first run, then veto system is needed
    - Vladimir insist on the importance of simulation for the new hcal design.
    - new VHCAL design was proposed in slide 8 of [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/840386/contributions/3525689/attachments/1891971/3120355/NA64_mu_plans.pdf][this]]
    - Reminded that CAEN mainframe is already in our possession
*** Sergei presentation about WCAL length optimization
    - some nice overview slide with general formulas in [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/840386/contributions/3525694/attachments/1891895/3120217/sng.pdf][this]]
    - resolution should be degraded by a factor square root of two
*** My presentation
    - Sergei points out that a very fast readout is needed for the WVETO to suppress the 
      pileup that spoiler very low energy deposit resolution.
    - included a third version of the wcal of 21 X0 active part of the dump and 10-15 X0 tail of catcher
      ===> energy resolution worsen by a factor 1.4-1.6
    - What is a good threshold for the VHCAL? Approximately 300 eV per plane, MIP should be used 
      for a tentative threshold.
    - most important optimization lies in the size of the hole and shape (tentative square dimension should still be used)
    - Muon simulation is more important as it will be less flexible to change in this case
    - Iron is to be substituted by copper! VHCAL is to be placed very near to the magnets
*** CERN open days
    - Poster was very well received
    - A page of comments was requested to help the russian part of the collaboration.
** <2019-08-23 Fri>
   - Vladimir asked for HCAL sampling, what is the energy resolution? He claims it should be 6%
   - Typically additional smearing is used to fit the data, maybe sampling is already like that?
*** signal simulation
    - Code right now is not sharable
    - Renat is tasked with include the implementation of the code using G4Classes
*** WCAL corrections
    - Endless discussion about LED correction if it is nedded or not. 
*** reconstruction
    - 1 event predicted from hadron, 3 observed
    - some other mechanism is making the peak sharper
    - Mikhail claims that a leakage of 3 MIP is impossible, why half of events should have 3 MIP,
      sharpness of the peak is unphysical
    - LOOOONG discussion about comparison of leak in the simulation of the ECAL
    - Idea of substitute random tail of other event
** Andrea Celentano presentation <2019-09-30 Mon>
   - [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/851881/][link]] to the event
   - Andrea Celentano presents his idea for the resonant production into dark matter (Dark photon specifically)
   - The presentation is aims for the ERC grant
   - Positron beam should give a unique boost to the cross section *but background?*
   - Suggestion are Jefferson lab
   - Sergei remarks in plot Fig.2 of Celentano presentation that the two experiment are quite compelementary
   - Vladimir remarks 
*** plan for the ERC *DARKPOS*
    - The first three year will be mostly about MC simulation and design
    - Why not using *NA64?*, the proposal is focused to the single channel of resonant production
      - If DM is produced like this, there should be an accumulation of missing energy (due to sharp resonance)
      - *ADVANTAGES*:
        - It is powerful, can use background subtraction an peak over the background. Also in case of discovery mass is immediately given.
        - ERC wants (high gain, high risk) scenario. Radition damage can be sold this way.
        - Very nice scaling to the fine-structure constant.
        - He has expertees in Electronmagnetic calorimeter.
      - *DISATVANTAGES*: 
        - One need a very good energy resolution for this. ==> ECAL must be very good (35 $X_0$), introduce more dangerous radiation damage
    - the demonstartion of the idea should happen the fourth year
    - NA64 connection might be too strong, so won't be underlined in the ERC.
** <2019-10-11 Fri>
*** Last result
    - [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/855043/contributions/3596479/attachments/1923631/3183004/DirectandNA64.pdf][presentation]]
    - NA64 independent from the precise dark matter model
      + fermion
      + Majorana
      + pseudo-dirac
**** XENON1T
     - Most powerful result, manage to extend the results to light dark matter (>30 MeV). See page 10
     - last bound cross section is $\sigma \sim 10^{-40}$
     - there is a double bound, one is less optimistic based on the background observed.
     - We did some comparison from our results and XENON, see page 13. This was done using a generic model
       + dependending on dark matter coupling $\alpha_D$ NA64 is better.
** <2019-10-18 Fri>
*** Report and search for long lived visible decay
   [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/857172/contributions/3608009/attachments/1928847/3194080/report-18oct2019.pdf][slides]]
    - Different variant checked
    - What cuts everything for the first variant in the ratio in the HCAL
*** Report of Renat over complementarity with XENON1T
    [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/857172/contributions/3608007/attachments/1928871/3194132/alps.pdf][alps plot]]
    [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/857172/contributions/3608007/attachments/1928871/3194133/cs-el.pdf][XENON1T plot]]
    - NA64 is able to explore parameter space of particle with mass with less than ~30 MeV.
    - Sergei points out one could see how sensitive we are to the ratio between Chi particle
      and mediator
    - There are some new results of the LUX experiment that could come in the plot as well.
    - Dmitry ask how we calculate the cross section. But for that curve we assume vector mediator interacting with electron.

*** Sergey news
    [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/862229/contributions/3632270/attachments/1941174/3219029/sng-news.pdf][presentation]]
    + Atomki new search:
      1. Similar decay width discovered by the Atomki collaboration
      2. Could this be estimate from Atomki the decay width?
      3. Could not be coupled to the photon (only at loop level). It cannot be a dark photon
      4. Number is constraint by the coupling to quarks
      5. Test from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-5}$ is interesting

**** comments
     - Samoyenko suggested liquid scintillator and Cherenkov radiation to check vertex in Z
     - Distance can be increased up to 1.3 m

**** comments
     - Out bounds currentyl are $\epsilon > 6.8 10^{-4}$
     - Calculate with both frequentist and Bayesian approach
     - Our last result means that coupling with electron with *vector current* is excluded <== *electron (g-2) already exclude completely our first case
     - *Pure axial coupling* is also excluded
     - *Chiral case* is still possible on the other hand
     - *Carefull* misprint in slide for espilon there is a -12 in the exponent instead of a -4

    - Mikhail calculated that the decay width is even larger than expected (*FOR SCALAR PARTICLES, NOT X17*
    - This will scale with large epsilon even more
    - This is not relevant for the X17 anomaly, since it is a pseudo-scalar particle

     - LDMX is in a good shape, beamline will be completed after 2 years, first run forseen for 2024-2025
       - They also want to extend the results for higher masses using 3 GeV muon missing momentum
     - By January 2021, we want to extend the proposal for 2-3 1E13 EOT at H4 and 2E13 MOT
     - We need to address the problem of running at high intensity

    <2020-02-26 Wed 10:39>
    - explanation of new setup for muon
    - main difference is that now the four modules are arranged side by side to improve hermeticity
    - two module of HCAL length gained (now only 10.7m are used from the 12 m available)
    - new beam profile shown in the slides
    - Some preliminary distribution with signal will be done for Friday
*** Energy resolution in NA64 calorimeters                            :henri:
    <2020-02-26 Wed 11:01>
    - Very complete summary
    - To be discussed what to put in the presentation for the collaboration
      - In general we plan to just put graphs with energy resolution and leave the rest in the back-up
*** Update on electro-nuclear interactions studies in NA64 invisible mode :pdegen:
    <2020-02-26 Wed 11:09>
    - bump was explained, it is the well known bremstrahlung bump
    - strawtube 1 shows more hit than the others, this is consistent between simulation and data
    - Need to increase step size in Geant4 to get proper energy estimation
    - Very nice correlation between R value and strawtube cut! Exactly as expected
    - Also HCAL profile is summarized in slides
*** AxPET performance                                              :benjamin:
    <2020-02-26 Wed 11:25>
    - some discussion about if the first peak observed is 55 keV or 88 keV peaks
    - ToFPET argue that it should be 55 keV, but this seems implausible from their explanation
*** NA64 semi-invisible mode                                         :cesare:
    <2020-02-26 Wed 11:35>
    - Verified that Dark Photon decay is indeed prompt in this parameter space
    - nice superposition of the two plots in slide 9

   *Meeting <2020-03-04 Wed 10:51>*
*** *muon mode (Laura Molina Bueno)*                                  :laura:
    <2020-03-04 Wed 10:52>
    - fixed bug on the vhcal
    - controlling HCAL modules (some weird difference in energy deposition)
      + maybe consequence of the shifts of the HCAL modules
*** *new visible mode setup (Emilio Depero)*                          :deppy:
    <2020-03-04 Wed 10:56>
    - http://positronweb.dhcp.phys.ethz.ch/indico/event/417/contribution/5/material/slides/0.pdf
    - Current position of the magnets seems to be sufficient, magnetic field has to be adjusted
      + current estimate say that at 1.3 T one would have 100% efficiency 
      + performance is similar if one uses ECAL or momentum from trackers for reconstruction the invariant mass
      + large tracker (~200mm) is needed to have full acceptance
*** *Energy resolution of calorimeters (henri Sieber)*                :henri:
    <2020-03-04 Wed 11:18>
    - http://positronweb.dhcp.phys.ethz.ch/indico/event/417/contribution/1/material/slides/0.pdf
    - Calibrated VHCAL
    - Punchthrough probability was tested, apparently a bit lower than what predicted, but still compatible
*** *Neutral punchtrough (Peter Degen)*                              :pdegen:
    <2020-03-04 Wed 11:23>
    - http://positronweb.dhcp.phys.ethz.ch/indico/event/417/contribution/3/material/slides/0.pdf
    - After new gas composition as was added, now most of neutrals are produced in Micromegas of new design (as it is correct)
    - agreement still to be adjusted between MC and DATA for the number of hits
      + Try to select events with hits on all strawtubes
      + Try to do hit matching
      + Suppress noise in the straw
    - some idea to improve the gas energy deposit by using smaller step-size
    - Pion simulation will be performed as cross-check
*** *performance of Axpet (Benjamin Banto)*                        :benjamin:
    <2020-03-04 Wed 11:35>
    - two module connected instead of only 1
    - First module working perfectly
    - Second module has still some problems, probably mapping is wrong
    - from six ASICs two are from another type (BGA instead of COB), this should
      already be accounted for in the maps but maybe not in an entirely correct way (TO BE CHECKED)
*** *Semi-visible mode update (Cesare Cazzaniga)*                    :cesare:
    <2020-03-04 Wed 11:41>
    - http://positronweb.dhcp.phys.ethz.ch/indico/event/417/contribution/2/material/slides/0.pdf
    - Using simulation it was estimated that the band should still be covered in the invisible mode using parameter of the paper
    - next step is calculate a few points from the simulation, then re-scale them for different parameter to see when semi-visible mode
      is powerful
    - Would be useful to have a second opinion about what have sense to change in the model

*** Micromegas todo list
**** Micromegas parameters
***** Large Micromegas
     - *Number to produce* 3-4
     - *Dimension*: 245x80 $mm^2$
     - *Strip size*: 256 $\mu m$
     - *length of flat cable*: 1.2 m
     - *multiplexing* 5
       + Multiplexing map to be discussed
     - *reduce material budget*
       + minimize the PCB thickness
       + Remove the copper/FR4 cover and substitute it with Mylar/Kapton
***** Small Micromegas
     - *Number to produce* at least 2, maybe 4 for the muon mode pilot run
     - *Dimension*: 80x80 $mm^2$
     - *Strip size*: 256 $\mu m$
     - *multiplexing* 5
       + Multiplexing map used is the one received by Procureur
     - *reduce material budget*
       + minimize the PCB thickness, or completely remove it using only Kapton substrate
       + Remove the copper/FR4 cover and substitute it with Mylar/Kapton
**** TODO tasks
     - [ ] Multiplex map for the large Micromegas, ask Procureur and produce a first estimate.
     - [ ] Discuss the reduction of material budget with CERN workshop
     - [ ] Understand the number of ADCs needed and ask *Igor Konorov* to produce them
       + We think 5 ADC are enough for all runs, two spares would be good
       + We currently have 1 ADC in good conditions (4 channels working) and 1 ADC that has only two channels working
     - [ ] Number of GeSiCa card needed
       + probably two will be needed (one can support 4 ADC)
     - [ ] Number of APV needed
       + following our estimate, we will need between 10-14 APV chips to work with all MM modules (depends on the number of MM used for the momentum reconstruction upstream)
**** Questions
     - How many Micromegas to be produce already?
     - In total we estimate 264 channels for a single Large Micromegas of 250 $mm$ transversal length. Two APV can read 256 channels. Possiblities:
       + Add one more APV chip (but most of the channel not used)
       + Reduce the length to 245 $mm$ would accomodate all the channels
       + other possibility would be to increase the strip size to 260 $\mu m$
     - ADCs? We will need new ADC from *Igor Konorov*
       + *Visible mode*
         + 4 Micromegas upstream for momentum reconstruction (2 ADC)
         + 2 Micromegas downstream decay volume (1 ADC)
         + 2 large Micromegas after MBPL (2 ADC, maybe 1 if long cable are produced, but given the reduced S/N this might be a risk)
         + *TOTAL ADC*  5 ADC
         + *TOTAL APV*  10-14 (depending how many MM are used for upstream momentum reconstruction)
       + *Muon mode Pilot run*
         + 4 Micromegas near the BMS station (2 ADC)
         + 2 Micromegas between ECAL and VHCAL (1 ADC)
         + 1 after VHCAL (probably 1 more ADC just for that)
         + 2 Large Micromegas between MBPL and S4 (1 ADC)
         + *TOTAL* 5 ADC
       + *Muon mode Physics run*
         + Produce 4 additional Micromegas for MS1

** Meeting with Igor <2020-08-03 Mon>
   <2020-08-03 Mon 14:06>
*** problem with rate
    - 20 kByte
    - A lot of data
    - 4 adc 4k, for 6 of them 5k
    - layout will be2 months, somewhere September for the production.
    - They will probably avaiable at November, then debug it. Then probably December.
    - Test bench at CERN? It should be avaiable.
    - 6 ADCs
**** Conclusions
     - ADC have a flat price of 1500Fr. for the base + 500 for any ADC produced
       + *We are planning to go with 6 ADC, for an estimated price of 5000 Fr.*
     - New design for APV are now used, one important point is that the connector will be changed. New Micromegas should be produced with the new connector already installed.
     - For the old Micromegas we will use the old APV (total of 8 are needed, currently ~10 in our possesion) *TO BE CHECKED AT CERN*
     - For the new Micromegas, 6 APV are needed *We plan to buy 8 more from Bernhard Ketzer*
