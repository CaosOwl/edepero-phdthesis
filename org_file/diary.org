** Leading Particle Shower
Technique to focus tracking on most relevant part of the shower and exclude the rest
*advantage*
 - faster computation
 - can increase production of certain particle (expecially for hadron)
*disadvantage*
 - only in FLUKA, not in GEANT4
 - Shower fluctuation not fully modelled
 - Energy deposit fluctuations
 - *WARNING* use weight windows to control weight fluctuation

*Presentation*: [[/home/deppy/polybox/PhD/materials/simulations/LeadingParticle.pdf]]
** FTF model
   *Fritiof string model*
   - hadrons turn into excited states in hadron-hadron inelastic interactions
   - If only one hadron is excited, the process is called diffraction dissociation
   - The excited states of hadrons are considered as quark-gluon strings
   - Strange particles are produced by the fragmentation of quark- gluon strings
      containing a strange quark or antiquark coming from the creation of ss̄ pairs from the vacuum.
   - After string formation string fragmentation follows using the *Lund fragmentation scheme*
   - Cannot be used for arbitraty low momentum, due to the fact that no kinematical restriction
     of the momentum of the (de-)excited string are set at low energies. Also cascading in 
     the nuclei is not incorporated by default.
   - First "wounded nucleon" are estimated using *Reggeon cascade* in the space of impact. 
     done using *DIAGEN* algorithm [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010465589900386?via%3Dihub][link]]
   - Second spectator nuclei are considered, they have some probability to be involved in the cascade
     (exponentially decrese probability)

** Bertini cascade
   for a review, try [[https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0168900215011134?token=9A161C20D620FAE6A9924EEB5AE39281EFFF40658C9EF8DFEFCD2804AA8ADC790A0AC23E46383A6CF9699C1D96B7964F][here]].
   - henerited by the old FORTAN intranuclear cascade INUCL
   - *CORE concept*
     - intranuclear cascade of hadron and nucleon produced
       through  a series of interactions withing the nucleus.x
     - classical model solving on average the Boltzman equation for the transport 
       of a particle though a gas of nucleons
     - The traditional range of applicability for such model is approximately 200 MeV < E < 3 GeV
   - A flow diagram can be found in the review
   - at 200 MeV deBroglie wavelength is roughly the same as nucleon distances
   - Above 3 GeV several effect breaks down the classical view
     - Lorentz contraction of target nucleus, too close together to be considered a gas
     - increasingly forward peaked final state angular distribution of hadron-nucleon
     - Increasingly time for secondaries to become quantum mechanically distinct
   - Secondaries propagate through the nucleus and interact until they either escape or
     they are stopped and absorbed
   - For the angular final state, for the two body [[http://gwdac.phys.gwu.edu/][SAID]] phase space parametrization is used
     whenever possible. Which replaced from 10.1 Geant4 the old Barashenkov polynomial representation.
     For other projectile other exponential representation is being used.
   - *IMPORTANT* "space-like" intranuclear cascade is typically being used. i.e. target nucleus 
     represented as continous medium. Potential represented by a set of concentric costant density
     shells whose depths approximate the Woods-Saxon shape.
     _Functional form:_
     $ r_i = c \ln{\frac{1 + e^{-R_N / c} }{ \alpha_i} - 1} + R_N $
     
     R_N is proportianal to the nuclear skin depth (~A^{1/3})
*** CPU usage
    - It was reported (see review) that bertini cascade was one of the most cpu intensive model used.
      this was discovered using the [[http://igprof.org/][igProf]] profiling tool. In version 9.4 the code was significantly
      improved. It was caused by chrun (unnecessary creation and deletion of variables)

   - More and more multithreading is one of the main focuses     
*** List of objects
    - 
    - *track* is a snapshot of a particle at a particular point along its path.
      instances of the classG4Trackcontain the particle's current 
      energy, momentum, position, time and so on, as well as its mass,charge, lifetime and other quantities.    
    - *trajectory* is a collection of track snapshots along the particlepath.
    - *step* two endpoints which bound the fundamental propagation in space or time.
      length is chosen byu a combination of transportation and physics processes.
    - *Process* has two meaning. one is in computer science sense. Theo ther
      other is the physics sense.
    - *run* is a series of *event*
    - multithreading implemented as *event parallelism*
    - scoring introduced to avoid self implementation. Scoring mesh consist of a scoring volume
      in a three-dimension mesh with a multifunctional detector. A given physics quantity, or score,
      is accumulated in each cell during a run.
      - Scoring volumes are placed in a parallel world, so mass volume and scoring volume can overlap

**** comments
     - pixels:
       + before magnet 8x8 cm^2 in size and a pitch of 228 mum
       + silicon sensor in front od DT chamber is 18x18 cm^2 
         and a pitch of 456 mum
     - DT Chambe
       + employed same technology as CMS experiment at LHC
       + four layers of wires each 
     - Most of positron energy is absorbed by the calorimeter,
       the rest is absorbed by the iron shield
     - Calorimter
       + lead-glass (PbWO4) section followed by a cherenkov section
         to differentiate between e and mu
     - Main background of the process is:
       - Bhabha scattering $e^+ e^- \rightarrow e^+ e^-$
     - Resolution of angle seems to be 0.5 mrad
     - Only 61 event were collected after all the cuts

*** questions
    - Is the beam necessarly positron?
    - How good is the resolution of the tracks after the iron blocks?
    - How large is the radiation length of the calorimeter
    - How large and how is done the final cut on the goodness of the fit
      to remove the combinatorial background? [[/home/deppy/polybox/PhD/materials/lemma/MainArticle.pdf::6][link]]
    - to what level electron mis-identification was negligible?
    - What is the minimal distance that can be identified between
      two particle in the Silica detector?
    - Why going to H2
    - Energy resolution

*** point
    - is it possible to remove one magnet and vacuum-pipe easily?
    - push magnet 1-2 meter upstream?
    - Three silicon and 1 small target (6 cm of Be) to be put upstream
    - possible to recycle the trigger system of NA64.
    - In principle they can reach a precision of 100 mum, but in principle it can be even more precise
    - Larger energy implies larger spread
    - Is it possible a couple of week of no beam time for them?

***** DONE [4/4] test with cosmics
      - [X] find a larger table
      - [X] put scintillators in place
      - [X] connect preamp to discriminator and scaler. Also put it in coincidence with the scintillators
      - [X] connect to the DAQ
Micromegas successfulyl built, attached to th e HV supply and grounded using copper tape
and connecting all the part on the bottom of the board. Similarly of Dipanwita
did for the last modules. Modules shows some litle sparks when the voltage applied
is high enough. Althought they respond clearly to th signal when the source is placed on them
it is not possible to read any current on neither the monitor of the suupply or
the Multimeter. Some consideration per modules are presented. The label is following the one
on the tape of each MicroMegas.

***** PRELIMINARY SCHEDULES FOR CHARACTERIZING MM<2017-08-03 Don>
****** Monday
       - Go to CERN workshop and mount the MM in their clean room (if available)
       - Go to Epool and collect 4 power supply for the MM
       - Go to prevessin site and mount MM, start to cook them.
       - Go to CERNshop, buy anything that is missing at prevessin and safe shoes
       - Go to the GBAR Meryn site, take time filter and preamp plus some 4mm pipe
       - return Meryn and setup up what's left
****** Tuesday-Wednsday
       - Test with cosmics, check avaiability of gas at ETH or source at CERN
****** Thursday-Friday
       - Characterize MM, test with DAQ
***** DONE inquire for the usage of the clean room, ask on <2017-07-31 Mon>
      the clean room should be used to mount the modules without putting any dust on the strips.
      inquire if we can use the room of oliver for th purpose.
****** entry1, inquired about the clean room<2017-08-03 Don>
****** 
       Asked Bertran, says he will tell me, contacted Sebastien and we can use
       his anyway if worst come to worst.
****** entry2, used it to complete the modules
***** collect chips in 892 building, date to decide
      there should be about 4 working chips in the 892 building usable for the test.
***** DONE ask if possible to place 6 mm inlet instead of a 4mm one
      if not probably better to buy different crosses and tools good for the 4 mm pipe.
****** Update1:<2017-07-31 Mon>
       Bertrand claims they just have 4mm in their lab. He tought maybe they can do something about it
       but they were pretty vague...
****** Update2:<2017-07-31 Mon>
       Not possible to mount the conversion. We will need to buy new material to bridge
       between the two different pipes. 
***** DONE [0/6] Buy materials to bridge between 6mm pipes and 4mm pipes
      - [ ] at least 4 bridges 6mm-->4mm (plus some spares)
      - [ ] crosses and tees for 6mm pipes to construct some paths
      - [ ] crosses and tees for 4mm pipes just in case (optional)
      - [ ] at least 50 m pipes (better 75) of 4mm for the experiment
      - [ ] 25 m pipes of 6mm as spare
      - [ ] *LOOK AT LAB 892 AT CERN TO SEE IF SOMETHING ALREADY AVAIABLE*
      Don't need them anymore, now inlet is 6mm gas.
***** DONE 6 holes in MM, see if they will do it or you have to do it

      new cables are needed for the new MM modules outside of the 8 SHV.
      - [X] 1 transition card at least is needed. Four are being requested to be sure
      - [X] inquire if more transition card are to be made (<2017-08-14 Mon>*UPDATE*: Paolo said they are not needed, but we should test them).
      - [ ] test all 8 *transition card*
      - [ ] 4 flat cables for the connection, (Try to ask Christian to assemble the new cables)
      - [X] Check if transtion cards have redundant addresses
****** DONE contacted Diogoto produce the cables<2017-08-12 Sam>
       he already has an extra transition card. I need to bring him a flat cables to remember him what to 
       produce.
****** ask Christian to assemble cables and retrieve component
** BGO
*** suppression factor
**** pions
     reapeated the simulation for pions flagging events with inelastic scattering (detected by checking for exotic particle different from e- and gamma). Subtracting those events
     from the count for the suppression factor reproduce the rejection of the data (run 1408) perfectly. Only two events survive in the bgo after multiplicity with similar energy deposit.
**** calibration correction
***** russian calibration
      the calibration was done taken the biggest bin in the range and equiparate it with 64 MeV. The following were found to be the largest bin in the relevant crystal:
      - cryst 3 :: 1390 
      - cryst 7 :: 1396
***** first try
     *Description* :: in order to have a more proper estimate of the calibration, we reapetead the simulation dumping pi- into the BGO crystal,
     and fitted the correspondent ditribution with a landau. Since the position of the crystal was not omogenous the distribution was a distorted landau
     which for small statistic looks pretty much like a gaussian. We did the fit for both a full staistic distribution of half a milion events and one simulation
     with events comparable to the ones collected in the staitstic. Different fit was used and the result compared, *the simulations was always fitted with a landau*.

***** update with shifted crystal
      the simulation didn't seem to fit well the calibration run, after checking the loogbook and comparing the date we found out the calibration run was done in vacumm and crystal 3,7
      were notably shifted from the peak position, which can be noticed from the big energy deposit left i the neighbour crystal 2 and 6. A new simulation with air in the pipe and crystal shifted of 2cmm with a beam spot 2cm large seems to reproduce the shape correctly and
      gives some resoanble calibration constant for the crystal which compare well with the simulation. The new peak position were fitted with a landau using the calibration run:
      - cryst 3 :: 1361
      - cryst 7 :: 1311
		   
      The energy position were fitted with a landau in the above mentioned simulation with the following energy deposit for a sample of 1000 events:
      - cryst 3 :: 34.3 MeV
      - cryst 7 :: 34.68 MeV
      
		   
      Later a larger simulation comparable to the sample of calibration was performed with the following result:
      - cryst 3 :: 33.4
      - cryst 7 :: 33.6

		   
      for a total calibration factor of:
      - cryst 3 :: 0.0245
      - cryst 7 :: 0.0256

		   
      for a total factor between our and the russian calibration of:
      - cryst 3 :: 1.88
      - cryst 7 :: 1.79
*** new analysis method
integrated pulse in the range after pedestal, new calibration for the run are:
| [MeV]                      | all crystal  | cryst 3    | cryst 7             |
|----------------------------+--------------+------------+---------------------|
| peak position[data]        | 736 [gaus]   | 1.089*cal7 | 177.4(5.3) [landau] |
| peak position [simulation] | 27.26 [gaus] | 8.304      | 5.729 [landau]      |
|----------------------------+--------------+------------+---------------------|

there is no peak to fit for crystal Nr.3, instead I tried using the proportion
between the two crystals found out with the MIP peak. mean of the synchrotron peak was found at *27.26 MeV* [fitted with gaussian around 20 and 40 MeV]
** SRD
*** calibration correction					:calibration:
    since the comparison is not as expected we reapeated the simulation for calibration purpose, shooting pions directly into SRD. the expected position of the peak was fitted with a Landau
    and distribution and seems to give a peak position which is approximately 2 times smaller as the one calculated from the simulation for a better agreement. Thea peak of the russian was calculated
    at a position of $\sim$ *80 MeV* while the one fitted with the landau distribution from the range [30,50] MeV had the following property
**** landau fit
     | Name     |  Value |   Error |
     |----------+--------+---------|
     | Constant | 7.46e3 |  4.63e1 |
     | MPV      | 4.22e1 | 2.20e-2 |
     | Sigma    |   2.01 | 2.20e-2 |
     |----------+--------+---------|
*** result for the suppression factor
    additional cut over the total energy spread, defined as the summ of the energy deposit squared for each crystals and divide by the total energy, together with a spherical cut
    where the summ of the energy squared must be less than 60 MeV squared, taken with the correlation plot. Was used to improve the suppression factor. The value are the following:
    - for a cut with multiplicity 0.6 MeV on each crystal the suppression was found to be *$/sim 3.5 \times 10^{-4}$* in the *data* and *\sim 2.7 \times 10^{-4}$* in the *Simulation*  
    - for a cut with multiplicity 0.6 MeV on each crystal, spherical cut with radius 60 MeV and energy spread less than 50 MeV the suppression was found to be *$/sim 1.2 \times 10^{-4}$* in the *data* 
    and *\sim 2.1 \times 20^{-4}$* in the *Simulation* 
      
      Possible worsening of the suppression factor for the *SRD* may be due the presence of no protection from the backscattering in the ECAL.
      *Remember:*
      - *Total events in the simulation* :: 300.000
      - *Total events in the data* :: 451.164

    Here a short description of the two ADC currently employed:
**** specific current needed
     The digital part (ADC) needs roughly 1.6 A to work, while the analoug part takes 0.3 A per chips typically (source: *Micheal*, value based on GEM recordings).
     Thr voltage supplied must be from -5 to 5 Volts. The reach this demand the following equipment is advised:
**** ADC v20012 (ADCMM34)
     - *VPSP* = 23
     - *MODE* = 29
     - *version* = 0x0110
**** ADC v20035
     - *VPSP* = 25
     - *MODE* = 13
     - *version* = 0x010f
**** firmwares
     This is a list of firmware sent b Igor in one of his mail

   1. apv4rich_top_20060821_0.bit - 20 MHz readout, version used at CERN apv4rich_top_20061110_0.bit - 20 MHz readout, version used at CERN

**** register 0x1001
     this is the meaning of the 8 bits in register 0x1001
     - bit 0 - :              '0' =
     - '1' =
     - bit 1 - readout mode:            '0' = latch all,   '1' = sparse
     - bit 2 - pedestal mode:           '0' = no pedestal subtraction,   '1' = pedestal subtraction
     - bit 3 - common mode offset mode: '0' = don't correct for CM,   '1' = subtract CM
     - bit 4 - :              '0' = ,      '1' =
     - bit 5 - skip data mode:          '0' = all APV data are there,   '1' = only headers, all data are skipped due to full buffers
     - bit 6 - sparse data format:      '0' = discard 2 LSBs of the last two frames,   '1' = discard MSB & LSB of the last two frames
     - bit 7 - time cut:                '0' = LALL sends all APVs for every event no cut on signal timing '1' = LALL sends even APVs for even events  and odd APVs for odd events

       *typical value of this register should be 0x8F* which means all first 4 bits (setting the letter F) are set to 1, and bit7 (setting the number 8) is set to 1 with bits 4,5,6 set to 0
**** Damage status <2018-01-26 Fre>
     The ADC was brought to *Diogo* for a preliminary analysis on <2018-01-26 Fre>, he suspect the problem is
     the ADC with version *v20035* as an inductor appear to missing *Igor* was contacted to clarify if he can
     provide us the blueprints/schematics of the card to make more sense of it. Some photos were done to
     show the damage:
     - [[./ADC/usedADC.jpg][both ADC]]
     - [[./ADC/workingADC.jpg][working ADC]]
     - [[./ADC/notworkingADC.jpg][not working ADC]]
     - [[./ADC/workingADC_detail.jpg][working ADC detail]]
     - [[./ADC/notworkingADC_detail.jpg][not working ADC detail]]
      In the meantime Diogo proposed to clarify if the responsability is of the ADC ot the transition card.
       Doing this during the date <2018-02-12 Mon>-<2018-02-16 Fre> could be ideal since Diogo will be at CERN.
***** TODO [0/2] diogo instruction <2018-01-26 Fre>
      
      - [ ] first check again that the ADC-transition card combo is function correctly.
      - [ ] use the same transition card of the working combo and put the ADC instead to test if it is also working.        

        *WARNING:* never connect working ADC to not working transition card as this could damage it
***** TODO Possible meeting with Igor Konorov on <2018-03-29 gio>
      To be confirmed, it would be a nice possibility to give a look to the transition card and understand the problems.
*** Bus Card								:bus:
**** Bus Card address Logic
     The following logic applies to bus card address:
     - the avaiable address range from 20 to 3e in step of two. i.e:
     - 20,22,24,26,28,2a,2c,2e and again with 3.
On the bus card four pin can be seen (R5,R6,R7,R8), they have the following logic:
| control | adress bit | synchronization with ADC | control bit |
|---------+------------+--------------------------+-------------|
| 1-R8    | R7-R6-R5   | 0                        | 1           |
|---------+------------+--------------------------+-------------|
- first bit always 1
- R8 decide the first number of address (0 = 2 and 1 = 3)
- R7-R6-R5 decide in binary the second number of the address in the order described above.
- synchronization decide how to synchronize apv (20MhZ sampling) with ADC (40MhZ sampling),
  for some reason always set to zero, otherwise gives some problems
- control bit always set to 1

*** Balint twiki
    Balint wrote a simple twiki on what to do during NA64 shift with the DAQ at [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/P348/MicroMega][link]]
** MicroMegas
*** *IMPORTANTE* 						 :importante:
    connectors of the APV chips are *female* right now in NA64,
    for GBAR *MALE* connectors will be needed.
*** information collected in the simulation
    the simulation collect information in several vector of length *N* which the
    number of hits colleted in the event. Thanks to this several analysis approach are possible.
    currently this are the information collected:
    - MM_X :: hit position in the X direction
    - MM_Y :: hit position in the Y direction
    - MM_Z :: hit position in the Z direction (which is basically the information of what MM was hit)
    - MM_energy :: energy of the particle that hit the MicroMegas
    - MM_energy_deposited :: energy deposited in the step of the hit
    - MM_particle_id :: Id of the particle that hitted the MM, mainly to keep track of the different particle
    - MM_particle :: which type of particle hit the MicroMegas, a list to translate number in the correspondent particle is given below.
**** MM_particle explanation
     translation of number into a particle
     - 0 :: particle not considered in the analysis
     - 1 :: electron
     - 2 :: muon-
     - 3 :: pion-
     - 4 :: kaon-
     - 5 :: gamma
     - 6 :: positron
     - 7 :: pion0
     - 8 :: neutron
*** simulation with 4 MicroMegas

*** little montecarlo for angle resolution
**** estimation on the residual
little Montecarlo simulation was developed to estimate angle resolution depending on MM number and distance.
This simple root Macro can be found here: [[/home/emilio/polybox/PhD/code/c++/montecarlo/angle_estimate.cc][MM_macro]].
the result of such Montecarlo is presented in the following table, a spread of 0.02/3 radiant was
choosen for the gaussian distribution of the true angle as suggested by Dipanwita.

       Dear editor,

       The manuscript DNR1091 presents an updated search for a hidden U(1)
       sector boson from the NA64 electron beam-dump experiment that improves
       on their 2017 result published in PRL 120 231802 (2018) [Ref. 58].
       NA64 stops a high-energy electron beam in a calorimeter (WCAL) and
       searches for dark bosons produced within the WCAL that decay between
       it and a second calorimeter ECAL into an electron-positron pair.
       Multiple detector and beam optics are used to ensure the beam purity,
       tag hadronically and muon produced backgrounds (notably Ko->pi+pi),
       and to maximize acceptance for dark photon decay events, especially
       for short-lived dark bosons.

       Between the earlier run and this run, several changes were made to
       achieve these goals: in particular, an increase in the beam energy,
       the lengthening of the decay path, a new vacuum pipe in the decay
       volume, and the addition of an additional thin veto counter, W2, after
       the WCAL. Following these improvements, a reduction in the backgrounds
       is demonstrated, using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations,
       detector modeling (notably for W2), and sideband analyses. When
       combined with the 2017 analysis, the bound on dark boson mass vs.
       coupling excludes couplings a factor of 2 larger than those excluded
       by the 2017 run, and significantly reduces the allowed parameter space
       for a new X(16.7) boson as claimed by studies of internal pair
       production from the 7Li(p,g)8Be reaction.

       The results presented in this paper are significant, important, and of
       immediate interest to the particle physics (and astrophysics)
       communities. The result clearly warrants publication in Physical
       Review D rapid communications. However, the manuscript itself requires
       significant revision in order to clearly present these results. I
       therefore recommend that the authors resubmit the manuscript with a
       further round of referee review. Overall, the manuscript is deficient
       in the following ways:
       *1) It does not clearly differentiate what is new with this result from what was published in 2018.*
       *2) The manuscript states but does little to validate the choice of optimizations made between the 2017 and 2018 runs.*
       *3) Most of the figures are difficult to interpret.*
       *4) The quality of the grammar and vocabulary is poor in places.*

       Beginning with the first deficiency, the manuscript would be
       significantly clearer if it explicitly compared itself to the
       publication of the 2017 result throughout rather than presenting
       itself as a stand-alone measurement. As it is already necessary for
       the reader to read the two papers side-by-side in order to understand
       the final result, do not hesitate to delete content (with the
       exception of the cut values) that merely repeats what is in the
       previous paper, and to concentrate on explaining the differences
       clearly. Of note:

       - The first three paragraphs of this paper were pulled almost in their
       entirety from the start of PRL 120 231802 (2018). As it is only
       appropriate to publish new results in PRD, this section needs to be
       rewritten from scratch. The authors also fail to mention recent
       developments in the field including the most important : the
       measurement of the same anomaly in 3H(p,g)4He as was seen in
       7Li(p,g)8Be (arXiv: 1910.10459). *agreed, need to be reworked*

       - The Figure 1 caption did not specify whether the 2017 or 2018
       configuration is shown when data from both configurations are used for
       the final result. *should it be specified in the picture? probably both*
       *of the setup need to be show*
       Similarly, it is unclear in Figure 4 or in the
       concluding text how much better this result is than the 2018 result,
       or how much of the improvement is due to better statistics versus that
       due to better systematics. I would suggest in Figure 4 showing a
       result for only the 2018 data overlaid on the combined result and
       adjusting the rest of the paper in order to present this. *agreed*

       - Nowhere in the paper, except in the abstract, is the total beam on
       target stated. *good point*

       - I notice that HCAL 3 is in a different position in 2018 vs. the
       position of HCAL4 in 2017, and that the numbering of the HCALs have
       changed. There is no statement or explanation of this change in the
       paper. *true, one should say that one of the calorimeter is being used*
       *as veto, maybe qouting the invisible mode paper for more explanations*

       - The text states there are 4 upstream micromegas, but Figure 1 shows
       8 micromegas and 6 straw-tube detectors. *figure need to be reworked*

       There are likely to be other important omissions or redundant
       statements that the authors should carefully review for.

       On the second deficiency, the paper notes a large number of changes
       between the 2017 and 2018 runs, but fails to quantify the effects of
       these changes. For example:

       - It is mentioned on page 4 that cuts iii) and iv) were relaxed
       relative to the 2017 analysis, but it's not clear by how much they
       were relaxed or what effect this has on cut acceptance. *Ok*

       - Many different means of increasing sensitivity to shorter-lived X
       bosons are mentioned, but the relative effect of them is not given. I
       would be particularly interested to know if, say, increasing the beam
       energy further, or reducing the thickness of the WCAL, could provide a
       few percent more sensitivity in epsilon to close the remaining allowed
       parameter space for the X(16.7.) *to be checked, but scaling are already given*

       On the third deficiency, the figures all need work.

       Figure 1: As mentioned above, it needs to be clearly stated that this
       is the configuration for the 2018 run in the caption.

       Figure 2: Is it not stated which lines are data and which are Monte
       Carlo, what these are distributions of (stopping power, energy
       deposited, timing ...) or why these figures are important. There is
       also a significant discrepancy in the bottom left plot of the figure
       that begs explanation. *agreed... already suggested that*

       Figure 3: The scale of this figure is so badly compressed on the
       y-axis as to make it useless above bin zero. As there is a cut on WCAL
       energy, this cut value should be shown. *agreed*

       Figure 4: This figure seems to show three events just outside of the
       signal region. The figure caption needs to make it clear that neutral
       events are likely to be gammas hitting the ECAL, and thus are not
       signal-like. There are no charged EM events in this figure. *also something that I suggested in the past*

       Figure 5: A comparison of the 2017 vs. 2018 results should be shown on
       this figure.

       Finally, with respect to grammar, I noticed a number of missing
       articles, pluralizations, strange prepositional phrases, and use of
       jargon.

       - The use of 'additionally inspired' requires an inspiration to be
       stated in the previous sentence.
       - 'into e+e- pair' requires either a plural or the article 'a'.
       - the reader may not know how to understand the unit of 'SPS spill'.
       Is the beam fluence 5e6 e- /4.8s = 1e6 e- /s ? (It is not.)
       - What is a MBPL?
       - 'material budget' is jargon
       - 'small level' -> 'low level'
       - What does the label (1) in 'primary reaction (1)' refer to?
       - 'The concrete cut was slightly different' sounds like a lot of heavy
       saws were used on the concrete foundation.
       ...

       Many of these typos will become moot once the previous deficiencies
       are addressed, but I would like to remind all of the listed authors to
       adequately review this paper prior to its next submission.
****** personal consideration
       oh man...
***** comments referre B
****** referee comments
       It was interesting to read the paper. The authors published similar
       results in 2018 in Phys. Rev. Lett., but after reading their present
       paper I still remain skeptical about their result.

       According to Feng et al., [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 071803 (2016), and
       Phys. Rev. D 95, 035017 (2017)] the coupling constant of the X17
       particle to neutrons can be much larger compared to the coupling
       constant of X17 to electrons. Since the range of the interaction is
       reasonably large (12 fm), I am expecting a sizable cross-section of
       X17 travelling through matter. As a consequence, in the NA64
       experiment a large fraction of the X17 particles created in the 29 cm
       thick tungsten target may be lost before getting out from the target
       itself. In this way your obtained limits for the electron coupling
       constant may not be realistic.

       Please estimate the loss of X17 particles in the WCAL target before
       publishing your results. It is clear that the reported results could
       be very important, but only if correct. At this moment I am not
       convinced.
****** personal considerations
       - Is it really the effect sizeable? Ask a theorist
       - The most relevant effect is still the very low decay length to be sure
       - What would be the consequence of an actual scattering? Probably not important
***** Mikhail request
      1. Do everybody agree that we should remove most of the introduction and motivation part? Personally I think it is not good because I cannot imagine that the readers will read two papers instead of one. Most of them will read only the latest one, and it will seem incomplete to them. But since the referee asks... *good point, probably introduction need to be rephrased somehow, or there must be some clear reference to the previous paper for deeper understanding*

      2. We probably should not delete the references to Fayet as they do not overlap with the previous paper.

      3. As we have to make many changes, I suggest that I substitute right now the paragraph about how the energy of the primary electron is divided between subdetectors in the experiment. As I said before, the old paragraph is inexact and overlaps with the old. And then Paolo continues to work on the text. I will not remove the old paragraph, but comment it out, so that Paolo can compare.

** discussion
*** entry1<2017-06-29 Don>
    many problems have to be adressed. The first one is how the hit reconstruction must be done exactly. There
    are some cases where is clear that one of the cluster has a double hits and has to b resolved singularly. Other
    where is clear that there are two different cluster. Others still where the situation is not clear and a decision has to be made.
    
    The first task will be to find a reliable way to define if a cluster is a ghost or not depending on how many strips it share
    with the main cluster and possibly other parameters like
*** entry2, development of reconstruction with multiplexing<2017-07-03 Mon>
    a first attempt of reconstruction using multiplexing was implemented. Starting from the true hits
*** entry3, update on code for the analysis of the mc<2017-07-24 Mon>
    more work done on the code *userexamplemc3.cc* was done today. Now the events
    are more properly collected in the various histograms depending on how many particle
    each MicroMegas sees, also boundaries of the histograms were improved. All relevant
    information saved in a etxt file to later simulate multiplexing. Completed analysis
    of all three simulation performed until now.
*** entry4, first analysis on the first four simulation <2017-07-25 Die>
    first analysis of simulating multiplexing on the three simulation done was completed.
    The effectiveness of the two algorithm, the one originally used in the previous beam time
    and the one developed to discover multiple particle that hit the MM simultaneously.
    Althought the new algorithm improves from 2% to 42% the effectiveness this is clearly not enough
    still, algorithm must improve the rejection of the ghost cluster and add possibility to recognize
    multiple particle clusters. All detail can be found in [[/home/emilio/workdir/scratch/dimuon-daq/p348reco/simulate_multiplexing/results/2017-07-25][results]]
*** entry5, work to improve algorithm  <2017-07-25 Die>
    some first attempt to improve the algorithm are being made. Investating number of shared strips
    with multiplexing for true cluster and and fake cluster. In the future ones should check by correlating it
    with the original size of the true cluster.

*** Di-muon  note of Mikhail Krisanov <2017-06-20 Die>
    The note [[/home/emilio/polybox/PhD/materials/na64/report/Note_dimuons_V2.pdf][di-muon-note]] regards the exatimation in energy deposit in the ECAL and HCAL of di-muons events
    and offer some selection criteria for the prupose.
    In particular it was found usefull that the optimal *bias factor for the di-muons cross section* was found to be *200*
    which avoids production of double di-muons events impossible in real life.
    also the following selection criteria were used for *di-muons selection*:
    - E_{ECAL} < 60 GeV
    - 2.5 GeV < E_{HCAL1} < 6.25 GeV (increased to 6.35 in data to take into account energy resolution and pileup effect)
    - 2.5 GeV < E_{HCAL3} < 6.25 GeV (increased to 6.35 in data to take into account energy resolution and pileup effect)
    Additionaly a value *0.8* was took into account in the MC as efficiency for the trigger and SRD criteria not simulated in the MC.
    
    It was also noted that in the visible run due to the significant backscttering in module 0 of SRD only 1 and 2 were used
    for the cut.
    in the *visible mode* only events in energy deposition smaller than 70 GeV (in the 100 GeV electron beam) were accepted as candidate.
    for the *visible mode* a value of 0.7 was taken into account for the trigger counter and SRD not simulated in the MC.

**** first sim <2017-06-29 Don>
     the first simulation was attempted using the standard geometry of example10 with few modification on the Z position
     of MM3 and MM4. Full detail over the geometry as well as the results can be found in the README in pcposeth5. results show that the MM are slighlty
     missalligned and this results in a reduced efficiency of 33% on both MM and 74% for just the first one. New simulation is
     underway, however preliminary simulation shows that in case of soft muon emitted the efficiency could still be imperfect.
**** second simulation <2017-06-29 Don>
     - second simulation commited. MM3 shifted by *32.86 mm* and MM3 by *24.73 mm*, this value were fitted from the Gaussian
       of the first simulation. MM3Z in this simulation was *-1840 mm* while MM4Z was *-1540 mm*, the begin of the WCAL is *-210 cm*
       and its end *-193.25 mm* approximately
**** third simulation <2017-07-03 Mon>
     - third simulation was done with the original position of MM in the visible setup (i.e. -1840 mm and -640 mm) but the shift
       in the x axis to optimize efficiency were used. Like in the previous simulation. Additionaly extra information about energy
       deposit, particle name and particle ID were stored to be later used.
**** fourth simulation<2017-07-07 Fre>
     geometry implemented exactly as stated in the condbb.h file of the official reconstruction program of Anton.
     Shift in the MM as well as ECAL and WCAL position were adjusted accordingly. Done to test feasibility of the setup
     used during last beam time in *2017*
**** fifth simulation<2017-09-10 Son>
     called setup-2, done both for dimuons with *200* pumped cross section and dark photon in visible mode with mass of *16.7 MeV*.
     MM are shifted slightly in the x-axis to improve efficiency. The position are 1840 and 1540 in dimuon simulation and 1240 and 940
     in the second simulation. This aims to offer a setup that can in principle be efficient for both dimuons and dark photon.

     *cut explanation*
     1) _mom_ : both particle must have that momentum [GeV]
     2) _oopcharge_: particle must have opposite charge
     3) _invmass_ : particle must have invariant mass in the range *WARNING* : _Still some doubt for the cut_
** confrontation of resolution for magnetic field 1.7 and 2.5 Tesla <2017-12-20 Mit>
   simulation was reapted with more statistic and more X-boson interaction. Some work was also done to test multiple
   resolution for the detector, although this was done in the same simulation, hence without accounting material budget.
   - The setup was 3 near monolithic detector near the point of interaction and one far away just before the ECAL:

**** table 1,  efficiency in detecting X-boson in the setup
     Efficiency is defined as the minimal number of track needed for a complete reconstruction in magnetic field.
     Which is three for both tracks in a X-boson event, i.e. the positron and the electron. The histogram is called *EventClass*
     in the folder occupancy.

**** cut to X-boson selection
     Strongest cut seems to be invariant mass, which is gave separate from the other. The other cut are summarized shortly below.
     *cut explanation*
     1) _oopcharge_: particle must have opposite charge
     2) _invmass_ : particle must have invariant mass in the range of [10,40] GeV
     3) _mom_ : both particle must have momentum of at least 1 GeV
     4) _perifery ecal_: energy deposit in the outer cell of ECAL (i.e. not the two central cell, see next plot) must be above 3 GeV

*** compare resolution
    This comparison was done using geometry [[geometry detail][this ]] , and artifically adding some smearing for the hit. 
    This of course does not take into account material budget. In the table is listed the interval around 0 that contains
    68.7% of the entries for the resolution in Z of the detector. The evolution of the cuts is stable enough for different
    resolution, and was therefore not accounted.

Discussion on how to implement sensitivity in *NA64* experiment.
** number of events expected<2018-03-13 mar>
   We typically quote the number of expected Dark Photon per EOT in the experiment as function of the mass $M_{A'}$ and 
   the mixing with the standard photon $\epsilon$ . A reference can be found here [[/home/deppy/PhD/materials/na64/Invisible_2016.pdf][here]]
   
   The equation looks like this:

   \[
   \begin{equation}
   n_{A'}(\epsilon,m_{A'},E_0) = \frac{\rho N_A}{A_{Pb}} \sum_i n(E_0,E_e,s)\sigma^{A'}_{WW}(E_e) \delta_{s_i}
   \end{equation}
   \]

*** description of equation  
    Where the equation states the following:
   where ρ is density of Pb target, N A is the Avogadro’s
   number, A Pb is the Pb atomic mass, n(E 0 , E e , s) is the
   number of e ± with the energy E e in the e-m shower at
   the depth s (in radiation lengths) within the target of
   total thickness T , and σ(E e ) is the cross section of the
   A 0 production in the kinematically allowed region up to
   E A 0 ' E e by an electron with the energy E e in the el-
   ∆n A 0
   ementary reaction (7). The energy distribution ∆E
   of
   A 0
   0
   the A s was calculated by taking into account that the
   e ,E A 0 )
   differential cross-section dσ(E
   is sharply peaked at
   dE A 0
   E A 0 /E e ' 1

 Hello, Emilio,

 About the number of predicted signal events. To calculate it, you need:

 1. normalization N

 2. number of triggers in the simulation T

 3. number of events from the sample that pass the selection by the reconstruction program P

 The first two values are printed out by the executable of the simulation paclage. N*P/T gives you the number of predicted signal events per 1 EOT.

 After that I can correct this number by the correction factor obtained from the dimuon analysis for the conditions of some runs range. It depends mainly on the intensity.

*** Shift of GEMs until optimal position <2019-01-14 lun>
    some investigation on the spectrum of dimuon is done to see how to shift the detector correctly in the simulation
    to reproduce the result observed. to do this relative position of the detector are recorded in the analysis to see how to shift
    the detectors.

*** Adjustment of the beam spot to match simulation with data <2019-01-14 lun>
    This section is used to investigate the beam profile and see the matching between the data and simulation
*** Beam studies                                                       :beam:
    Beam profile was analysed in the run of 2018 to match better simulation. Some shift in the gems were discovered using this skript.
    Plots of this can be found in: [[/home/deppy/polybox/PhD/org_files/run_May_2018/plots/BeamSpot][beamspotplots]], here are found some beam messhing to estimate the amount of hadron present in the beam. As
    well as some gaussian profile.
    - <2019-01-30 mer>
    Same procedure was performed for MM after preliminary beam fixing was performed. Result of full analysis can be found in  [[/home/deppy/polybox/PhD/org_files/run_May_2018/plots/BeamSpot/provadimuons.root][results]] . 
    Also there is a file in the same directory that shows shift in MM needed to retrieve same beam spot.

*** TODO [0/3] [#A] First priority
1. [ ] detail simulation and cross check of hadron profile. Ratio of charged/neutral punchtrough. Simulation of hadronic
   shower profile in the HCAL for $\pi$, $K_L$ is required
2. [ ] Building framework for MVA analysis of shower profile in NA64

* SWOT Analysis
** Strength
   - We are a young group with a lot of motivation and will to experiment.
   - Our fields are very diverse and they give us a very nice overview of physics. It is very nice to discuss with other people in the group
     and understand what happens in their very different experiment.
** Weakness
   - Experimenting a lot means also that many problems arises as we find out new things!
** Opportunity
   - Learn many new things and experience how a real experiment in particle physic is performed
   - Test newtechnology and analysis method can potentially improve the status of our field
   - Meet many other peoplex and confront different methods
** Threat
   - Many times the experiment difficult to predict. An unforseen background or some problem with the setup 
     can potentially be show stopper.

* PhD summary
  The main focus of this thesis was the development of the code used in the context of the NA64 experiment (https://na64.web.cern.ch/) and the analysis of all data collected. Additionally, it was my responsibility to take care of the 8 Micromegas detectors used for the momentum reconstruction in all data taking performed since 2015. This included the testing of the 4 new modules produced in 2017, their integration and calibration in the DAQ, and the improvement of the software that reconstructs the hits position and the momentum of the incoming particle. From the analysis side, my focus was the study of the data collected in the visible mode setup. Outside of many MC studies to estimate the efficiency of the selection criteria and possible source of background, I followed an alternative approach that uses the trackers in the decay volume to improve the standard analysis performed using only calorimeters. Although the improvement was minor, it proved the power of the tracking procedure. The study was also used to underline some important limitations of the visible mode setup and to design the new generation of this experiment that will cover Dark Photons with large coupling $\epsilon$. Although not directly involved in the invisible mode analysis, many of my studies indirectly impacted all of the analysis performed in the context of NA64. This included (but not limited to) Synchrotron radiation as a tool for heavy charged particle rejection, shower profile analysis for hadron rejection, precise simulation of hadron shower inside the calorimeters, large scattering of neutral and study on the $K^0_S$ as a source of background.
