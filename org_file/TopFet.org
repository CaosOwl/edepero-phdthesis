** advises for small signal detection <2019-04-17 Wed>
   
   Hi Johannes,

   you need to acquire data in ToT mode.
   QDC mode has not enough resolution to be able to distinguish such small
   signals.
   
   You should also set all trigger_2_* settings to 0 (use only threshold
   T1 for triggering), set fe_delay to OFF and and scan the vth_t1
   threshold.

** Optical grease
   Some optical grease was ordered by Vladimir and typically used for the HCAL.
   We could use it to improve the coupling with the SiPM.

*** advised from Hamamatsu
**** mail
     
     Thanks for your email.
     
     The MPPC series S13360 is basically well suitable for your application, and surely the first choice to start your  tests with.
     Besides 1.3mm and 3mm types, we also have 2mm types (in this case TSV instead of wirebond).  -> Art.No S13360-2050VE
     
     For your reference,  I attach below the overview catalog for MPPC series S13360 .
**** questions
     - What is time window in which you will get this few photonelectrons. And what is your signal frequency? *WLS decay, 12ns. very low (cosmic)*
     - Are your tests related to ProtoDUNE (SP or DP) ? *Nope, NA64 related*
     - About how many pcs will you roughly need in future for your test *to discuss*
**** products advised
     If there is no other request by you, I will propose 50um pixel types and SMD package
     i.e. we will prepare a quote  for 1-5pcs each of following MPPCs

** Low Signal configuration
   an email was sent suggesting some specification for low signal measurements
*** email content
    Hi Johannes,
    
    As Ricardo previously mentioned, for short signals (low energy) you should use the default "acquire_sipm_data.py" script in TOT mode
    (there is an option flag when launching the script allowing to chose to acquire in QDC or TOT mode).
    Also, you should edit the "config.ini" file and add the following lines in the [asic_parameters] section:
    
    channel.trigger_mode_2_t = 0
    channel.trigger_mode_2_q = 0
    channel.trigger_mode_2_e = 0
    channel.trigger_mode_2_b = 0
    channel.fe_delay = 0b10000


    With these settings you are only using the threshold t1 to discriminate the ascending
    and descending part of the pulse (and compute the corresponding TOT). E and t2 discriminators
    are not used with such trigger mode settings. From our tests with attenuated laser pulses and these settings,
    we never obtained the bad artefacts of high and negative TOT such you show in your plot.
    
    Best Regards,
    Luis

** Time resolution analysis of detectors based onplastic scintillators coupled to siliconphotomultipliers
   Excellent article,
   One thing that they test, is how much of a difference you get with and without optical grease!
   They also compare different methods for calculation of the timing, using different pulse thresholds (10%, 20% etc) 
   and also one method where the slope of the pulse is calculated in order to determine the timing.
   I think this might be very interesting to you, with respect to the SiPM tests you are carrying out downstairs!

      + All time resolution were assumed to be equal for the time calculation
      + nice review plot at page 17
      + value are around 100 ps
