* Software meeting <2019-03-06 Wed>
** Points
   - Check why is longer than 150 GeV in MC for simulation
   - Correction of SRD and V2 to be corrected, like the one we used currently
   - 2 was significantyl miss-calibrated
   - Dimuon number dropped significantly after number in 4298
   - 8 Events found in the region,1 with WVETO2 energy is zero
   - Think hard about possible background for tracking
   - Electron calibration shown in the agenda is not known
   - *Problem*: very small number of dimuons, in the last 9 run of visible mode
** TODO [ / ] tasks
 - [ ] Think hard about possible background of tracking analysis
 - [ ] rechek efficiency for tracking in 2018
 - [ ] Check MIP in run 4266 or 4265 Vladimir think this could be an explanation
 - [ ] FIX WCAL[2]
   - [ ] Try to work on timing adjustment
