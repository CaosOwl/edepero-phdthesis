** $\pi$ contamination in $\mu$ COMPASS beam
   Samoylenko started a study to see the pion contamination in the muon COMPASS
   beam. Here is a first analysis of his:

** review of Mikhail code example 203 <2019-09-23 Mon>
   - hole is just 5 cm compared to Vladimir drawing (8cm)
   - Compared to Vladimir drawings, VHCAL is only 40cm (compared to 1 m)
   - Width is 30 cm, it is not very clear from Vladimir drawings but it should
     have a distance of at least 5 cm from undeflected beam, (from HALO of beam Core?)
   - Hodoscope all commented out. Why?
   - V12 implemented? Veto immediately the second magnetic field
   - New drawing show new HCAL and counters inside the magnet, is it useful for the trigger?
** TODO starting rewriting the code <2019-09-25 Wed>
   1. following the specification on [[./NA64e_mu_plans.pdf::7][page7]] copper should be 20mm and counter 2mm but by dividing the
      length of the calorimeter by 35 each layer should be 30 mm, 8mm are missing.
   2. If one check the interaction length for [[http://pdg.lbl.gov/2019/AtomicNuclearProperties/HTML/copper_Cu.html][copper]] one get 4.57 $\lamba$ for 20mmx35, while for
      28mm one get 6.3, one would think that the calorimeter as some empty space to compensate for that.
** Answer of Mikhail
   Mikhail answered themail with my concers. Some *questions* arises 
   from his answer.
   1. What is the priority? Muon mode or electron mode?
   2. Still no idea how to boost background... figure of merit will be needed.
   3.

** NA64 Meeting <2019-09-27 Fri>
   - I prensented [[/home/deppy/polybox/PhD/presentation/NA6427092019/NA6427092019.pdf][this]] in the hope of getting some answer...
*** Answer to me questions
    1. Electron mode and muon mode very different, 8 cm would be for electron
       while 6 cm for muon. Mikhail propose to roll back to previous specification 
       for muons
    2. Just put the vacuum at the very end of the layer
    3. Emphasis should be put on the eelctron mode, but modular version of the calorimeter 
       could be used instead making it possible two different design for the different modes.
** Talk with Laura <2019-09-30 Mon>
   - nothing too much to be reported

* simulation                                                     :simulation:
** TODO [5/7] Questions
   - [X] Size of the hole?
     According to Mikhail preliminary studies, the hole should be rectangular and no more than 6 cm in muon mode
   - [X] Longitudinal size of the calorimeter?
     Larger as possible, but might run into space issue
   - [ ] possible to put trackers inside the calorimeter? Would give more flexibility to the setup.
     Probably not... *BUT CHECK IT*
   - [X] Use same VHCAL for muon and electron? need to be discusses.
     Mikhail proposed modular geometry, condition are generally very different
   - [X] Two example, can only be used one?
     but 204 can do both things (background simulation and signal)
   - [ ] Visualization in repository switch one?
   - [X] Which trigger design to choose?
     Laura claims [[./documents/Muon_proposal.pdf::32][trigger1]] will be used
   - [ ] How much is the treshold possible for the VHCAL?
** instruction for Running MuonMode simulation <2019-10-01 Tue>
   This are the instruction for example 203 after modification, soon the same will be applied 
   for example 204
*** setup
    The setup na64-tools/geant4/simulation/examples/Condor/config/setup_lxplus_g4105p01_muonmode.sh is
    used for the simulation (both in lxplus and in Condor)
*** to build it
    After bulding the core and sourced the setup, just type after cd in the example:
    - ./runconfigure_roothisto
    -  make
      
    if one has to make sure that no old file are left and rebuild it from scratch, type beforehand:
    - make clean
    - ../clean
*** To run it
    See the README in the folder
*** Some important option
    - If the number 3 is choosen in ModeOut (option /NA64/Output/mode <modeout-number>), only event
      with a minimum energy deposit will be saved as output (number of trigger is still saved, so that the rate can be recovered).
      You can customize the energy in line: https://gitlab.cern.ch/P348/na64-tools/commit/a53cf1834665c5af10ad9362f338287ed6390d0e#b0095d56482fbb0563a0e5ddc9c791bcf1f7ed7e_600_602
    - By default event seed are saved if more than 1 GeV is deposited in the VetoCal. 
      To customized these value see line:https://gitlab.cern.ch/P348/na64-tools/blob/master/geant4/simulation/examples/example203/NA64SD.cc#L763
    - Particle in the MCtruth detector are saved only if they carry more than 1 GeV energy.
      Customize this value at: https://gitlab.cern.ch/P348/na64-tools/blob/master/geant4/simulation/examples/example203/NA64SD.cc#L411
*** Send job in Condor
    The usual machinery can be used to simulate event in Condor, i.e. in folder
    na64-tools/geant4/simulation/examples/Condor/
    Use the bash skript ExecuteSimulation.sh:
    
    *./ExecuteSimulation.sh <number-of-jobs> <number-of-events-per-jobs> <configuration-file>*
    
    *WARNING:* 
    + the setup file has to be adapted to the folder of the user
    + By default queue espresso is used, change it if you want larger number of events simulated.

** Neutral cross section
   - [[/home/deppy/polybox/PhD/materials/Start materials/physics/Geant4/Nuclear_Interaction.pdf][page of nuclear interaction]]
*** comments
    - Photonuclear data based on about 50 Nuclei which
      have been measured in the energy range :
      + *Giant Dipole Resonance* (GDR) region, extends from 10 MeV
        to 30 MeV

      + *Quasi-deuteron* extends from 30 MeV to around pion threshold.
        Characterised by small cross section and a broad low peak

      + the *$\Delta$ region* characterised b dominant peak in the cross
        section from Pion threshold to 450 MeV

      + *Roper resonance region* from 450 MeV to 1.2 GeV. Cross section is not strictly
        identified with the real Roper resonance because other process 
        occur in this region

      + *Reggeon-pomeron region* is all the rest

        + This contribution was parametrised as follow:
          
          \[
          RP(e,h) = h \cdot th(7, 0.2) \cdot (0.0116 \cdot exp(e \cdot 0.16) + 0.4 \cdor exp(3 e \cdot 0.2))
          \]

    - Only 14 Nuclei are currently used in the parametrization though

    - For *ElectroNuclear*
      
    - Equivalent Photon Approximation (WW) was proposed bu E.Fermi and then developed by WW.
      A covariant form now exist.
      + When using this method is important to take into account that real photon are always transverly polarized
        while virtual photon might be longitudinally polarized.
    - In General ElectronNuclear cross-section for *ElectroNuclear* interaction can be expressed as:
      
      \[
      \frac{d^2 \sigma}{dydQ^2} = \frac{\alpha}{\pi Q^2} (S_{TL} \cdot (\sigma_T + \sigma_L) - S_L \cdot \sigma_L)
      \]
    - This can be rewritten as:
      \[
      \frac{d^2 \sigma_{eA}}{dydQ^2} = \frac{\alpha}{\pi Q^2} ( \frac{(1 - y/2)^2}{y^2 + Q^2/E^2} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{m^2_e}{Q^2} ) \sigma_{\gamma^* A}
      \]

    - last term for small Q^2 can be approximated to depend
      on $\vu$ and the cross section of virtual photon is considered
      to be $\epsilon$ indepedent

    - Electronuclear problem can be splitted in two:

      + at small Q^2 one use the independent cross section discussed before

      + for $Q^2 \gg m_e$ it necessary to calculate the effective virtual-photon cross section
        For $y \ll 1$ and $Q^2 < 4m_e^2$, and $Q^2 < m^2_e$ lead to the result:

        \[
        \frac{y dn(y)}{dy} = -\frac{2\alpha}{\pi} ln(y)
        \]
**** Final state generation
***** Gamma-nuclear
      - For high energy gamma, QGSP model is used.
        - Incedent gamma treated as QCD strings
        - remnant nuclear is de-excited using the GEANT4 precoumpound and de-excitation sub-models
        - At lower energy, Bertini-style cascade is used
        - Another handlng of low energy is handleded by the 
          *Chiral Invariant Phase Space* model
        - LEND (low energy nuclear data model) utilised evaluated data to sample
          the final states of gamma-nuclear interaction to high precision.
          - particularly suited for incident gammas below 20 MeV with higher precision
            than Bertini-Cascade
***** Electro-Nuclear
      - Generation proceed in two steps
      - step one:
        + vertex of electron/positron nucleus reaction is calculated
        + Virtual photon generated by sampling parametrised Q^2 and vu distributions
        + equivalent photon method is used to get a real photon from this distribution
      - Second step:
        + real photon is interacted with teh target nucleus at the hadronic vertex
          assuming photon can be treated as an hadron
        + below 10 GeV photon can interact directly with nucleons using measured partial
          cross section, this is done by Bertini-cascade
        + Above 10 GeV this is done by FTFP model
