*** source of uncertainty                                       :uncertainty:
    section that discuss source of uncertainty
    There are generally two source of uncertainty, statistical and systematic (not dependent on the number of event)
    - simulation used for training the DN is not accurate
    - *precision / optimality* important for analysis optimization,
    - An automated approach to estimate those uncertainty is *Bayesian Neural Network* some reference in the article
    - to estimate tha *accuracy / bias*, network is fixed and input are varied.
