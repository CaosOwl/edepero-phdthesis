     - result based on Wilks and Wald to avoid large MC computation
     - estimation of the median significance by replacing data sets by a single
       representative one, called Asimov dataset
     - formal mathematical justificaiton of the method
     - numerical implementation is presented in *RooStats*
     - For purpose of exlcuding a signal hypothesis, a threshold of p-value 0.05 (Z=1.64)
       is typically used
     - a method for the binned analysis is described
     - Likelihood function is defined as product of Poisson probability for all bins
     - To test the hypothesis we consider the profile likelihood ratio:
       
       $\lambda(\mu) = \frac{L(\mu,\theta)}{L(\mu,\theta)}$
       - the numerator is the profile likelihood function, where theta maximize L for a specific mu

       - the denominator is maximized (unconditional) likelihood function.

     - The presence of nuisance parameter typically broadens the profile likelihood as a function of mu 
       relative to what one would have if their values were fixed.

     - sometime the expected signal \mu can be regarded as negative as long as the total expected 
       entries of each bin are positive for convienience

     - The final test statistics is defined as:
       
       $t_{\mu} = -2 \ln{\mu}$

       - higher value of t_mu corresponds to increasing compatibility between the data and mu

       - we can test the compatibility of a specific value of mu by using the statistics t_mu
        corresponding to increasing disagreement, to quantify the level of disagreement:

        $p_{\mu} = \int_{t_{mu},obs}^\infty f(t_{\mu} | \mu)dt_{mu}$

       - where the lower limit is the statistics t_mu observed from the data

       - I will not cover the case where mu=0 is effectively the signal, if mu is expected to
         be different from zero.
