   - [[https://gitlab.cern.ch/P348/na64-tools/-/tree/eth-semivisible][eth-semivisible]] all relevant code for the semivisible mode analysis developed together with *Cesare Cazzaniga*
   - [[https://gitlab.cern.ch/P348/na64-tools/-/tree/eth-muonmode-2021][eth-muonmode-2021]] used for feasbility studies for the muon setup, developed mostly by *Laura Molina Bueno* and *Henri Sieber*
** Reconstruction 
   The relevant software to reconstruct the data in the standard NA64 format can be found here: https://gitlab.cern.ch/P348/p348-daq
   Relevant branches to this project includes:
   - [[https://gitlab.cern.ch/P348/p348-daq/-/tree/eth-reco][eth-reco]] to reconstruct the data for visible/invisible mode
   - [[https://gitlab.cern.ch/P348/p348-daq/-/tree/eth-reco-muonmode][eth-reco-muonmode]] to reconstruct data for the muon mode to be used in 2021, mostly used for feasibility studies
   - [[https://gitlab.cern.ch/P348/p348-daq/-/tree/eth-reco-semivisible][eth-reco-semivisible]] create for *Cesare Cazzaniga* to save all reconstruction code for the semivisible mode. Used mostly for feasibility studies
   - [[https://gitlab.cern.ch/P348/p348-daq/-/tree/eth-straw][eth-straw]] Create for *Peter Degen* to reconstruct straw hits.
** Analysis
   Tools used for the analysis on the reconstructed data can be found in my own ETH repository at https://gitlab.ethz.ch/na64/na64analysis
** Simulation of Micromegas output
   A dedicated repository was written by me to simulate Micromegas response for different assumption and multiplex mapping.
   The idea behind this deposit is to use the input of NA64 data to simulate the response as reliably as poissible, including noise an extreme topologies, but
   it also supports clustering created by simple physical models. It can be found here: https://gitlab.ethz.ch/na64/mm-clustering
** Plotting the exclusion plot
   data and code for the exclusion plot mostly used some gnu plot provided in the form of some text file.
   The git repository with the relevant information can be retrieved here: [[https://gitlab.cern.ch/P348/NA64-exclusion-plot]]
   To compute the exclusion limit in the full frequentist approach a sample can be found here: https://gitlab.cern.ch/P348/na64limits

* Presentation for X17
  A small presentation to review the X17 anomaly.
** Main points
   - One need to use a nuclear transition with reasonable statistics, resonant transition particularly helpful  [[10.1103/PhysRevD.95.035017]]
   - Best fit is 1.07 compatible with a particle being emitted [[10.1103/PhysRevD.95.035017]]
   - With mild assumption Scalar and PseudoScalar are disfavored [[10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.071803]]
   - pi0 decays prevent A' from being an explanation
     + This can be circumvented if the new 1-vector boson couples vectorially to quark with a suppressed couplings to proton
   - It mediates a weak force with range 12 fm
   - Protophobic gauge bosons are not particularly unusual. The Z boson is protophobic at low energies, as is any new boson that couples to B − Q, the difference of the baryon-number and electric currents.
   - *BOUND TO COUPLING*
     + To produce the observed e þ e − events, the coupling to electrons must be nonzero. This coupling is bounded from above by the shift the new boson would induce on the electron magnetic dipole moment and from below by searches for dark photons at beam dump experiments.
     + The neutrino coupling, in turn, is bounded by ν–e scattering experiments, as well as by the nonobservation of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering.
** Be- Nucleus

   - Ground state is only 0.1 MeV
   - our focus is on the transitions of the 1 þ isospin doublet to the ground state
   - We refer to the ground state as simply 8 Be and to the 1 þ excited states with excitation energies 18.15 MeV and 17.64 MeV as 8 Be  and 8 Be 0 , respectively
   - The properties of these states and their electromagnetic transitions have been analyzed using quan- tum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques using realistic, micro-scopic Hamiltonians
   - hese decays can be classified by their parity (electric, E, or magnetic, M) and partial wave l. A p-wave magnetic transition, for example, is labeled M1
     + The spectra of electron- positron invariant masses and opening angles in these decays are known to be monotonically decreasing for each partial wave in the SM
     + Spectra of electron and positron pair are known to be decreasing monotonically for each partial wave in the SM  https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.78.184
     + 8 Be  decays to 7 Li p most of the time, but its electromagnetic transitions have branching fractions Brð 8 Be  → 8 BeγÞ ≈ 1.4 × 10 −5 and Brð 8 Be  → 8 Bee þ e − Þ≈3.9×10 −3 Brð 8 Be  → 8 BeγÞ 
** X17 possible properties
   - We consider the cases in which it is a scalar or vector particle with positive or negative parity. In this reaction, its de Broglie wavelength is λ ∼ ð6 MeVÞ −1 , much longer than the characteristic size of the 8 Be nucleus, r ∼ ð100 MeVÞ −1 .
     + In this regime, the nucleus looks effectively pointlike, and one can organize the corrections from the nuclear structure as a series in r=λ.
     + The candidate spin/parity choices for X are as follows: a 0 − pseudoscalar a, a 1 þ axial vector A, and a 1 − vector V
   - *CANDIDATES*
     + Scalar candidate cannot mediate 8Be* decay. Angular momentum requires the final state to have angular momentum L=1 (final state of two 0+). This makes the final state odd while the initial state is even.
     + Pseudo-scalar Axionlike particle,all photon coupling are excluded by experiments [[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP02(2016)018]]
     + Axial vector candidate put strong restriction with neutral pion pi0 --> Xgamma
       * Unfortunately, large uncertainties in the nuclear matrix element for axial vectors make it difficult to extract the required couplings for this scenario. To the best of our knowledge, there is no reliable ab initio calculation or measurement of the matrix element we would need in the 8Be system.
     + Vector candidate
   - If the X boson couples only to the charged SM fermions required to explain the 8 Be anomaly, one has BrðX → e þ e − Þ ¼ 1. Note, however, that if ε ν ≠ 0 or if there exist light hidden-sector states with X charge, then there are generically other decay channels for X.
   - The higher limit of epsilon is calculated by the number of observed events by the ATOMKI collaboration
   - According to the [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01151][last article of feng]]:
     - Assuming parity conservation, scalar si excluded and pseudoscalar is highly disfavored
     - Protophobic vector boson also explains the He4 within experimental uncertainty
     - Finding this is two nuclei means that the particles must pass test for both kinematic and *dynamic* consistency.
     - 
*** Vector candidate
    - A new fermionic couples to a current which is a linear combination of fermionic current
    - i.e. $iX_u\sum_{i=u,d,l,\vu}\epsilon_i e J_i^{\mu}$
    - coupling is differentiated to up-down quark, charged lepton and neutrinos
    - Conservation of charge for X implies a matching between coupling of neutron and proton current
    - The branching ratio is calculated by assuming isospin conservation in the nuclear transition.
    - Possible model:
      + This is related to the effective coupling in Eq. (7) by g V ¼ εe. Substituting this into Eq. (15) and comparing to the experimental result in Eq. (2), one finds that ε 2 ≈ 10 −4 , which is experimentally excluded by, for example, π 0 → A 0 γ searches at NA48/2 [44].
      + A generalization of the dark photon idea is to consider also mixing between the new boson and the SM Z. Such a particle is spin-1 with no definite parity. Unfortunately, bounds from atomic parity violation are extremely stringent [45] and constrain the dark Z couplings to be too small to explain the 8 Be anomaly.
      + Another type of spin-1 particle is a light baryon-minus- lepton number (B − L) boson [46–48]. This scenario is constrained by neutrino scattering off electrons and, assuming no kinetic mixing, provides the upper limit g B−L ≲ 2 × 10 −5 [49], which is again too small to account for the excess.
      + 
      +
*** Signal dependence  on isospin mixing and breaking
    - Previous discussion based on well defined state and isospin conservation
    - Isospin breaking can be very relevant and must be used for the calculation of the full transition
      + This is included using *spurion formalism* That is, we include isospin-breaking contributions through the intro-duction of a fictitious particle, the spurion, whose purpose is to allow the inclusion of isospin-breaking effects within an isospin-invariant framework.
      + Full nuclear structure calculation
      + meson exchange current
      + Since the largest effects should stem from the neutron-proton mass difference, the spurion acts like a new ΔT ¼ 1 its size is controlled by ðM n − M p Þ=M N , where M N is the nucleon mass
    - In the case of perfect isospin isoscalar transition dominate and the summ $\epsilon_p + \epsilon_n$ dominate the ratio
    - in case of isospin breaking isovector dominates  $\epsilon_p - \epsilon_n$ dominates the transtion
    - *in  case of X17 isospin breaking only amount to 20% of the branching ratio, large value of $\epsilon_p$ are already excluded by NA48/2*

*** Constraint from other experiment

***** Proton fixed target experiment

***** charge kaon and phi decays
      similar to pi0 but smaller
***** Other meson and baryion decays
**** Electron coupling costraint
     The X boson is required to couple to electrons to contribute to IPC events. In Eq. (31) we gave a lower limit on ε e in order for X to decay within 1 cm of its production in the Atomki apparatus. In this section we review other bounds on this coupling.
***** Beam dump experiment
      > 2 10^{-4}
***** magnetic moment of electron
      strongest bound comes from anomalous magnetic moment of electron which costraint new boson to be 
      < 1.4 10^{-3}
***** electron positron annihilation into X and into a photon, $e^+ e^- \rightarrow X\gamma$
      from BABAR <2 10^{-3}
***** Proton fixed target experiment
      CHARM experiment costraint from below, since the decay has to be low enough not to be inside the constraint of CHARM. > 2 10^{-5}. wekaer than the analogous from beam dump
***** charged kaon and phi
***** W and Z decays
**** neutrino coupling constraint
***** neutrino nucleus scattering
**** Summary of constraint
     Assuming a complete SM branching ratio:
     - $\epsilon_n = (2-10)\times10^{-3}$ 
     - $\epsilon_p < 1.2\times10^{-3}$
     - $\epsilon_e = (0.2-1.4)\times10^{-3}$     
     - $\sqrt{\epsilon_e\epsilon_{vu}} < 3\times10^{-4}$     

** Atomki Experiment
   - A beam of protons with kinetic energies tuned to the resonance energy of 1.03 MeV collide with Li nuclei to form the resonant state 8 Be  , and a small fraction of these decay via 8 Be  → 8 Bee þ e − .
   - The spectrometer is instrumented with plastic scintillators and multiwire pro- portional chambers in the plane perpendicular to the proton beam. These measure the electron and positron energies, as well as the opening angle of the e þ e − pairs that traverse the detector plane, to determine the distributions of opening angle θ and invariant mass m ee.
   - The experiment does not observe the SM behavior where the θ and m ee distributions fall monotonically. Instead, the θ distribution exhibits a high-statistics bump that peaks at θ ≈ 140° before returning to near the SM predictionat θ ≈ 170°
   - 

*** systematic uncertainty
    - particle pass a number of consistency check
      + as it is highly non-relativistic (0.017c), pair products should have similar energy, one expects small jyj and m ee ≈ E sinðθ=2Þ
      + An anomaly had previously been reported in 8 Be 0 decays [[10.1016/j.nima.2015.11.009]]. This anomaly was featureless and far easier to fit to background than the bumps discussed here, and it has now been excluded by the present Atomki collaboration.
      + No pair creation is observed in the similar 8Be' channel, this strongly suggests that the particle decays is *kinematically and not dynamically* suppressed
      + It also suggests that with more data, a similar, but more phase space-suppressed, excess may appear in the IPC decays of the 17.64 state.

** Critics
   - enhancement could be created by gamma-gamma process in the nucleus enhanced by Modified Bethe Heitler process
     1) Broad middle state for the peak
     2) oerientation of the multiplecoefficient due to the emission of one of the gamma
     3) Match qualitatively, but pair production is in the order of 1\%, where are all the extra photon?
   - Forbes article
     + they quote [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Oops-Leon][oops leon particle]]
     + Forbes pointed out that calibration curve seems a bit problematic in the exact region where the anomaly lies
   - Quantamagazine article
     + already two past paper that suggest a boson anomaly disappeared later
     + Apparentyl they express gratitude to Fokke De Boer, who allegedly has a big history in anomalies in nuclear transtions. But he died before this new work
     + They are accused of cherry picking, meaning that they never publish work where no anomalies is found
