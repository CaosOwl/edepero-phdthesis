* Short description
  This files describes the progress on PhD thesis of Emilio Depero. It was created on <2020-01-13 Mon>.
* Instructions
  To create the pdf, simply type in the command line:

  *make*

  To view the file type:

  *make view*

  *NOTE:* The Makefile uses latexmk to compile the .tex file and evince to visualize it. Be sure 
  to install these two programs before using the respective comand. Alternatively, The main file PhDthesis.tex
  in the folder *thesis/* can be compiled using any program of choice.
* TODO [0/1]Issue to solve
  - [ ] Currently the abstract command fails for unknow reason. But the text is visualized as intended.
    Currently the Makefile is structured to ignore any error and produce the output anyway. <2020-01-14 Tue>
