The results obtained by the NA64 experiment were already significant to probe a large fraction of the parameter space of the $\umodel$ model. As shown in the previous chapter many other interesting models, including ALPs, light scalar, and protophobic vector boson are within the reach of this experiment. With the current data, it is already possible to exclude that the dark photon is a viable explanation of the muon anomalous magnetic moment $\ammu$. Most of the parameter space justifying the protophobic vector boson $\DMX$ theorized to justify the anomaly observed in the nuclear spectrum of $^8$Be and $^4$He was also covered by the data collected in the visible mode.

In this chapter, we will explore the prospects for the NA64 experiment, by outlining the main future goals and by detailing the upgrades that will be performed on the setups. We can summarize these in three items:

\begin{itemize}
\item Cover the region of parameters in the $\dmyplane$ plane most compatible with the observed relic abundance of DM assuming a freeze-out mechanism taking place in the early universe.
\item Probe the region parameter space justifying the $\DMX$-anomaly.  
\item Increase the sensitivity for both the invisible mode and new models with a novel setup using muons as primaries.
\end{itemize}

For the case of the invisible mode, where we are mostly limited by the cross-section of production, improvements in the setup are marginal to increase our signal yield, thus we are mostly limited by the number of EOT accumulated. A value of $5 \times 10^{12}$ was estimated to be a feasible goal to explore the parameter space illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:dm-alpha-excl}. The upgrades of the setup need to address the background that will be encountered for such a large number of EOT, especially the dominant background of electron-hadron interaction upstream of the ECAL.
For the case of the visible mode, on the other hand, the signal yield is dominated by detector efficiency. This means that an improved setup can significantly boost the signal yield, letting us access region of parameter space characterized by a large coupling $\epsilon > 1 \times 10^{-3}$ to finally probe completely the $\DMX$ parameter space.

In Sec.\ref{ch5:sec:mm-upgrades} we will present the upgrade for Micromegas detectors that will be used for the NA64 setup. This upgrade will benefit all setups with a decrease in material budget and larger transverse acceptance. In Sec.\ref{ch5:sec:new-invismode-setup}, we will cover the main upgrades for the invisible mode setup, and give a background estimate for the large data collection expected. In Sec.\ref{ch5:sec:new-vismode-setup}, we will present a new setup optimized to cover the remaining region of $\DMX$ parameter space by taking into consideration the lesson learned by performing a tracker analysis on the 2018 data set. The new setup will also be capable of reconstructing the invariant mass of a particle decaying after the dump, which will permit the measurement of the $\DMX$ to be matched with the one already performed in \cite{Krasznahorkay:2015iga,Krasznahorkay:2019lyl}. Finally, in Sec.\ref{ch5:sec:muon-mode-setup}, we will briefly discuss a new setup using a high-intensity muon beam to probe a novel region of parameter space.

\section{Micromegas upgrade}
\label{ch5:sec:mm-upgrades}

An upgrade of the Micromegas detectors will be needed to decrease the material budget and improve the tracking procedure. As seen in chapter \ref{chapter3}, the main background for the invisible mode is caused by electro-nuclear production upstream the ECAL that causes a large amount of energy to escape transversely. To decrease the chances of these interactions to happen, the material along the beamline needs to be minimized. The next generation Micromegas will use a 100 $\mum$ Mylar window to seal the gas box, instead of the thick copper/PCB seal used in the last design. The PCB on the bottom will also be built using a honeycomb structure of 3 mm and 100 $\mum$ of glass epoxy to connect the PCB to the XY strips. The existing modules are also modified in the same way as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:mm-old-new}. A hole was cut in the copper seal with the same dimension of the active area ($80 \times 80$ $\mms$) and sealed using an aluminized Kapton Foil. The advantage of this technique is that the material is used at the same time to seal and to apply the voltage needed by the drift.

\begin{figure}[bth!]

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\pdirfive/mm-new-old.pdf}
  \caption[old and new Micromegas design of the gas box seal]{Left: old Micromegas modules used during 2018 beam time with Epoxy+Copper seal for the gas box. Right: same module after the seal of the gas box is substituted with an alumined kapton foil to decrease the material budget.}
  \label{fig:mm-old-new}
\end{figure}

The performance of the new modules was tested first using a $^{55}$Fe to trigger ionization in the gas chamber and after by using cosmic muons to directly compare the efficiency with the old modules. The chambers were found to have a comparable efficiency, with the disagreement of 1\%. Some small drop in the voltage along the foil was observed using the $^{55}$Fe, but no significant degradation of efficiency was observed \cite{philip-swork}.

A second upgrade will be the production of larger Micromegas modules to increase the acceptance in the bending direction. These new modules will be used in the upgraded setup programmed for the visible mode and the novel setup design for data collection using muon primaries, detailed in Sec.\ref{ch5:sec:new-vismode-setup} and Sec.\ref{ch5:sec:muon-mode-setup} respectively. The new modules will be of dimensions 245$\times$80 $\mms$, with a pitch size of $250$ $\mum$ as already used for the previous modules. They will still use genetic multiplexing, with a total of five strips readout by each channel. This amount to  960$\times$80 strips read out by two APV25 chips, for a total of 256 channels \cite{apv-useguide}. The dimensions were chosen as a compromise between the acceptance and cost-effectiveness of the modules. Using a MC-simulation, it was checked that a length of 245 $\mmi$ is sufficient to reach an acceptance of $\gtrsim$95\% in both visible and muon mode.

The hit resolution is not expected to change as the pitch size of the strip will remain the same. However, a new multiplex map was developed for both 80$\times$80 $\mms$ and 256$\times$80 $\mms$ Micromegas to further reduce the redundancies and prevent weird cluster topologies caused by close strips connected to the same channel. The new map for the small Micromegas modules was improved under the principle to maximize the distance between strips connected to the same channel. In the old mapping, this minimal distance was 3, which caused some cluster distortions in specific regions of the plane. In the new mapping, this distance was increased to 16. The new multiplex map for the larger plane was performed similarly, the minimum distance was found to be 24. The complete description of the new maps is given in Appendix.\ref{sec:multiplex-maps}. The maps were also tested using a toy Monte-Carlo: clusters are generated starting from templates obtained in the calibration run collected at low intensity, and then placed in a random position on the plane. This study revealed an excellent homogeneity of the map. The residual of hits, defined as the difference between the true hit position and the one reconstructed using the NA64 cluster finder, was found to be constant along the plane.



\section{Improvement to the invisible mode setup}
\label{ch5:sec:new-invismode-setup}

The next goal for the NA64 invisible mode setup is to increase the statistics of the data collected to probe the interesting region of parameter space compatible with the relic density observed today in the freeze-our scenario and cover a large fraction of the parameter space of pseudo-Dirac and Majorana Dark Matter. The amount of EOTs needed for this purpose was estimated to be 5$\times 10^{12}$, as can be seen in the projection shown in Fig.\ref{fig:dm-sens-proj}.

\begin{figure}[bht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{\pdirfive/tldra-19-2-alpha_0_5.pdf}

  \caption[sensitivity projection for invisible mode 2021]{Limits on the $\dmplane$ plane assuming a number of EOT collected of 5$\times 10^{12}$ by extrapolation of the results obtained using 2016-2018 data set. The parameters are the same used for the calculation presented in Fig.\ref{fig:dm-alpha-excl}. The favored parameters to account for the observed relic DM density for the scalar, pseudo-Dirac and Majorana type of light DM are shown as the lowest solid line.}
  \label{fig:dm-sens-proj}
\end{figure}

Since our signal yield depends exclusively on the cross-section of $\DM$ production, the rate of the signal is expected to be the same. We need to take care of the background expected at this large statistics. We saw in chapter \ref{chapter3} that the dominant contribution comes from electro-nuclear scattering in the beamline before the target. In this section, we will try to study them more in detail and estimate their contribution to a larger sample.

In Fig.\ref{fig:enucl-position} we see the frequency of nuclear interaction for different positions along the beamline predicted from a dedicated MC-simulation. Micromegas detectors are the leading contribution to this background, as a result of their large budget material, which in terms of interaction length is approximate $\lambda_{int} \simeq 1.9 \times 10^{-3}$. It is noticeable however that a factor $\sim 2$ less electronuclear interaction is happening in the first Micromegas of the beamline. This is the result of the smaller material budget of this module, which uses a mylar window instead of a cooper top to close the gas box. The reduction of the material budget of the rest of the modules will be an important improvement to suppress this background and has been discussed already in Sec.\ref{ch5:sec:mm-upgrades}. Furthermore, the transverse coverage of the setup will be also increased. Naively this can be done by increasing the size of the HCAL, but this solution is rather expensive and would require very large HCAL. Instead, a new detector called VHCAL\footnote{Veto Hadronic Calorimeter} is used for the same purpose. This detector is a Copper-scintillator sandwich calorimeter with a hole in the middle to remove the material in the way of the beam. This detector posses lateral size of $50\times50$ \si{\centi\meter\squared}, and is placed upstream the ECAL in front of the vacuum tube exist just after the first tracking detectors as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:vhcal}

\begin{figure}[bth!]

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\pdirfive/enucl-position.pdf}
  \caption[electronuclear interaction position]{Z position of electronuclear interactions between the end of the vacuum tube and the start of the first HCAL. A total of 2.5$\times 10^6$ EOT were simulated for this distribution.}

  \label{fig:vhcal}
\end{figure}

To properly account for this background, we follow the procedure described in \cite{na64-neutrals-study,pdegen-thesis}, which is reviewed here.

First, we divide the $\ehcalplane$ in 10 different zones as depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:enucl-bkg-estimation}. The zones divide the distribution of observed events in several tiles at different distances from the signal region. All the regions labeled with even numbers are events where the energy is conserved and $R$ value (defined in Eq.\ref{eq:R-factor}) is closer to the one plotted for region II. In events inside the zones labeled with an odd number, on the other hand, some energy is missing from the initial primary electron. The two most relevant are region 7) and 9), which include a part of the signal region. These events have an $R$ distribution closer to the one depicted in region III, with a sharp peak at 1. To further classify the events in these two regions, we can construct a new category based on the value of $R$. We define $n_i(r)$ as the number of events in the region $i$ with distance $r$ from the center of the HCAL. Using this definition we can define three categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item $n_{5,7}(r=0)$ is the number of events with any energy deposited in the HCAL.
\item $n_{5,7}(r=r_{cell})$ is the number of events with $R=1$, i.e. no energy is deposited in the central cell of the HCAL.
\item $n_{5,7}(r=3r_{cell})$ are the event where particles are emitted outside of the HCAL and $R$ is not defined.
\end{itemize}

The final goal is to calculate the probability of an incoming electron primary to produce an event that fall in one of these categories. Which means computing:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:enucl-prob}
  p_i = \frac{n_i(r)}{n_{EOT}}
\end{equation}

In practice, the distribution of $n_{i}(r)$ is fitted using an exponential distribution and then integrated in the region $n_i(r>r_{cell})$ relevant for the background. We are finally ready to estimate the number of events expected for an arbitrary statistic:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:exp-bkg-inv-2021}
  n^{bkg}_i \simeq n_{EOT} \times p_i(\lambda \times r)
\end{equation}

In our case, $n_{EOT} = 5 \times 10^{12}$, and $\lambda = r'_{cell}/r_{cell}$ is a scale factor, we define here $r_{cell}$ as the total radius covered in 2018 and $r'_{cell}$ as the equivalent cell radius that will be covered in 2021. Assuming a VHCAL placed at 3 \si{\meter} distance from the ECAL, the coverage would roughly amount to an HCAL with two times its current transverse size, thus $\lambda = 2$. By using our fit for $p_i(r)$ and evaluate it for the zone 7 and 9 relevant for our signal region and $r = 3\lambda = 6$ the maximum region covered by the VHCAL. Our current best estimate for this background is 5$\pm$3 events after taking into account the reduced material budget of the Micromegas \cite{pdegen-thesis}. We illustrate this background extrapolation in Fig.\ref{fig:enucl-bkg-extrapolation} for both region and comparing MC and data, fitted with an exponential distribution.

\section{Improvement to the visible mode setup}
\label{ch5:sec:new-vismode-setup}

The main goal of the visible mode data taking in 2021 will be to probe the remaining parameter space that justifies the $\DMX$-anomaly. Back in chapter \ref{chapter1} we gave an overview of the possible models, and in chapter \ref{chapter4} we shown that in the case of a protophobic vector boson the data collected by NA64 constraints the possible coupling to $6.8 \times 10^{-4} < \epsilon < 1.4 \times 10^{-3}$. The mass of $\DMX$ can also be calculated with high precision by fitting the nuclear spectrum of the anomaly. This procedure currently gives compatible results for the two atoms studied, claiming a mass of 16.70$\pm$0.85 \mev for Beryllium and a mass 16.84$\pm$0.36 \mev for Helium. The current setup is unable to probe this particle, as the analysis of the visible mode data has shown. Currently, the main limitation comes from the short decay length of the $\DMX$ and the inability to separate the $\ee$ using trackers. A sufficient setup will need to boost the signal detection efficiency to a level where the $\DMX$ can be probed with a realistic number of EOTs and add a spectrometer able to measure precisely the invariant mass of the $\xdecay$ decay. In summary, to improve the setup we need to address the following items:

\begin{itemize}
\item Increase the probability of the $\DMX$ to exit the dump up to at least 20\%.
\item Increase the distance between the trackers and the decay base of the $\DMX$ to allow the separation of the $\ee$ pair by at least a few mm.
\item Allow the momentum reconstruction of the $\ee$ pair in the $\xdecay$ decay with an accuracy of $\sim$1\%.
\end{itemize}

In the sections that follow, we will explore each of these issues, and provide a solution to each of them in the new design of the setup for the visible mode 2021 data taking.  Finally, we provide a projection of the EOT and time needed to cover the anomaly completely.

\subsection{Invariant mass reconstruction}
\label{ch5:sec:new-vismode-setup-invmass}

The novel setup proposed for 2021 aims to further improve the background suppression and add the full invariant mass reconstruction for the decay of a very short lived particle generated at the beginning of the dump. In this section, the reconstruction technique is illustrated and the main challenges are outlined. A study based on a full MC simulation of the setup is used to demonstrate the power of the method and its capability of probing the parameter space left to justify the $\DM$ anomaly.

The remained unconstrained parameter space for the coupling $\epsilon$  corresponds to a extremely short-lived $\DM$ with the lifetime $\tau_{\DM} \lesssim 10^{-13}$ s. In chapter \ref{chapter1} we computed the decay length in Eq.\ref{eq:dm-decay-length} as a function of the coupling $\epsilon$, the mass of the mediator, and its energy at the time of emission.
We observe that the energy of the produced $\DMX$ has to be $\gtrsim$100 $\gev$ to have the decay length 30 mm comparable to the dump.
Additionally, as $E_{\DMX} \gg \mee$, the minimal $\ee$ opening angle and the invariant mass are given by
\begin{equation} 
\angee^{min} \simeq  \frac{2\mee}{E_{\DMX}},
\label{eqn:angle}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mee = [E_{e^+} E_{e^-}]^{1/2} \angee
\label{eqn:imass}
\end{equation}

For an energy $\sim$100 \gev, the average angle is $\sim$0.34 mrad, which is challenging to be measured with precision $\lesssim 10\%$. Instead, we use the short decay length to fix the vertex position of the $\xdecay$ decay and we reconstruct $\angee$ from the separation of the $\ee$ pair in the trackers placed downstream. As the $\DMX$ is a short-lived particle, its decay vertex $Z_{\DMX}$ is located at the vicinity of the WCAL $Z_{WC}$. This means that $Z_{\DMX} \simeq Z_{WC} \ll L_D$ where $L_D=Z_{T1}-Z_{\DMX}$ is the distance from the decay vertex and the first tracking detector (see Fig.\ref{fig:imass_sketch}). Since $L_D \simeq Z_{T1} - Z_{WC}$, the opening angle $\angee$ can be evaluated as 
\begin{equation}
\angee \simeq \arctan{\frac{ L_{\ee}}{L_D}}
\label{angle-est}
\end{equation}
where $L_{\ee}$ is the distance of the $\ee$ pair in the T1 plane. Using error propagation, we can estimate the uncertainty on the angle:

\begin{equation}
  \sigma^2_{\angee} \simeq (\sigma_{L_{\ee}}  / L_D)^2 + (\sigma_{L_D} / L_D)^2(L_{\ee} / L_D)^2,
  \label{eqn:thetaerr}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{L_{\ee}}$ is the hit resolution of the tracker and $\sigma_{L_D}$ is the error of the decay base. In our conditions, the second term is negligible due to the high precision of our tracking detectors and the large distance between them and the target. The formula above shows that a tube of $\sim$10 m is sufficient to reconstruct the invariant mass with a precision $\lesssim$10\%. However, this estimate is flawed by the fact that hit resolution worsens as the two hits are closer.

\begin{figure}[bth!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\pdirfive/imass_sketch.png}
  \caption[Invariant mass reconstruction sketch]{Sketch of the $\DMX$ decay in the proposed setup along the beam axis.}
  \label{fig:imass_sketch}
\end{figure}


This problem has been studied using both fitting procedures and neural networks to reconstruct the original hit position from two overlapped clusters. The data recorded with a gas detector during past NA64 runs were used to build a set of different possible topologies. A new set to test different algorithms was then created by mixing these clusters randomly. An example of such a study, where the two clusters are separated using a global fit of two Gaussian is presented in Sec.\ref{ch5:sec:separ-hit-micr}. Both procedures agree that the hit resolution worsens to a maximum of \SI{200}{\micro\meter} when the separation is lower than 1.5 mm. No significant worsening in the resolution is observed when the distance between hits exceeds $\sim$2 $\mmi$. In the proposed setup, a distance of 18 m is used between the dump and the first tracker, getting an average separation of 5.5 mm (Fig.\ref{fig:dm_dist1}). As our data-driven studies have shown, the hits should be well separated in each signal event, granting a hit resolution of \SI{80}{\micro\meter} for the $\ee$ pair.

\begin{figure}[tbh!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\pdirfive/DM-dist.pdf}
  \caption[Distance of the decay products of X17 in the 2021 setup]{Distance between decay products of an $\DMX$ decay outside the dump at a distance of 18 m from the decay vertex.}
  \label{fig:dm_dist1}
\end{figure}

To complete the invariant mass reconstruction one needs to know with high precision the momentum of the decay products in a signal-like event. Two independent measurements are used for this purpose. The first one is the momentum reconstruction of the two tracks after passing through a magnetic field. The second one is the measurement of the same two tracks energy in two well-separated em-showers in the ECAL downstream. A dipole magnet bends the two tracks and separate them to reconstruct their energy with a precision of 10\%$/\sqrt{\gev}$ in the ECAL. To achieve this purpose a separation of at least two ECAL cells ($\sim 8$ \si{\centi\meter}) is needed.

The setup proposed uses an \SI{18}{\meter} vacuum tube kept at a pressure of 8$\times 10^{-4}$ \si{\milli\bar}. Two GEM trackers \cite{gem} are placed at a distance of \SI{0.1}{\meter} and \SI{2.1}{\meter} respectively from the end of the tube. A magnet is placed immediately after the second GEM to separate the two tracks that are detected by a set of GEM trackers placed at \SI{0.3}{\meter} and \SI{1.3}{\meter} from the end of the magnet. Finally at a \SI{3.4}{\meter} distance from the end of the magnet the ECAL is used to measure the energy of the incoming particles. A sketch of the setup can be seen in Fig.\ref{fig:setup-2021}.

  \label{fig:setup-2021}
\end{figure}

The invariant mass is reconstructed with a precision of $\sim$2\% (Fig.\ref{fig:imassreco}). The fit is performed using the sum of two Gaussian functions with a shared mean corresponding to the best estimate of the invariant mass. Furthermore, 90\% of all events are reconstructed with an error smaller than 10\%. This reconstruction was performed using a MC simulation where all detectors budget was reproduced precisely to estimate the impact of the multiple scattering. This is detailed in Sec.\ref{ch5:sec:mm-scattering}.

    \label{fig:imassreco}
  \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Multiple scattering effects on invariant mass reconstruction}
\label{ch5:sec:mm-scattering}

An additional source of error is caused by the multiple scattering experienced by the $\ee$ pair produced from the $\DMX$ decay. As the decay takes place immediately after the dump, the multiple scattering experienced originates from:

\begin{itemize}
\item The air pocket between the end of the WCAL and the beginning of the vacuum tube.
\item The two Mylar windows used to seal the vacuum tube.
\item \SI{18}{\meter} of low pressure air inside the tube.
\item The air pocket between the tube and the trackers used to measure the distance of the two decay products.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, one has to consider that the thickness of W2 placed after the WCAL can also have an impact on the multiple scattering. This effect is however suppressed since most of the $\DMX$ where the decay vertex is inside the W2 are normally removed from the analysis by the requirement of small energy deposit in this active area. The thickness of this counter was minimized to \SI{3}{\milli\meter} from the \SI{6}{\milli\meter} used previously. This reduces the contribution of multiple scattering and at the same time increases the $\DMX$ detection efficiency since the dump length is further reduced.

The vacuum tube is placed attached to the WCAL aluminium box to minimize the air pocket down to $\sim$1 $\mmi$. Moreover a thin \SI{175}{\micro\meter} Mylar window is used to seal the vacuum tube which is then kept at a pressure of 8$\times 10^{-4}$ \si{\milli\bar}. The first detector is placed immediately attached to the vacuum tube to reduce the air interaction to a minimum. The second Micromegas tracker is placed at \SI{2}{\meter} distance from the first one to compromise between angle and momentum resolution. All the materials were added in the MC simulation of the setup and their effects were studied in detail. The conclusion of this study is that the multiple scattering has a small impact on the precision of the reconstructed invariant mass, the degradation observed compared to a scenario where only perfect vacuum is present between the end of the WCAL and the first tracker is $\sim$0.1\%. The contributions on the invariant mass width, including limited position resolution and momentum reconstruction, are summarized in Table \ref{tab:imass-width}.

\subsubsection{Hit separation in gas tracking detectors}
\label{ch5:sec:separ-hit-micr}

The NA64 experiment uses gas tracking detectors to reconstruct the incoming momentum of the electrons and reconstruct tracks in the decay volume. A set of 8 XY-multiplexed Micromegas and 4 GEM modules were employed in the invisible and visible mode setup for this purpose. As introduced in Sec.\ref{ch2:sec:vismode}, one of the main challenges of the novel setup design will be to separate two tracks at low distance in order to reconstruct the angle of the two-body decay.

A set of clusters was extracted from the calibration data at low intensity to ensure that only single-hit clusters were present in the sample considered. The true position of these particles were saved before randomly mixing the clusters in a new set mimicking events where two particles are hitting the trackers simultaneously. After this, a double gaussian fit was used to extract the position of the two initial clusters, and the results of such procedure were compared to the known initial positions. The fit was performed using the Minuit2 minimizer implemented in the ROOT framework \cite{root}.

The results of this study are summarized in Fig.\ref{fig:res-hit} where the hit resolution, defined as the mean difference between reconstructed hit and the true one, is shown as function of the hit separation. The results here are presented in strip size to present the problem in a general way. The part of the curve where the distance between the two clusters is between 2 and 8 strips shows a reduced hit resolution. The reason is that in this region the resulting cluster shape is significantly distorted and the fit accuracy decreases. For very close distances on the other hand, the cluster shape converges again to the one of a single gaussian, improving the fit result. In the specific situation of the NA64 experiment, Micromegas have a strip size of \SI{256}{\micro\meter}, which make the two clusters separated at 9 strips ($\sim$2.3 $\mmi$). Some events with reconstructed hits exceeding a residual of 1 $\mmi$ can be found for a separation smaller than 10 strips. These hits are typically caused by some abnormal cluster topology that break the gaussian assumption used by the fit. For hits with separation larger than 2 $\mmi$ no such events are observed anymore. In the setup proposed, the minimum distance between the decay products is 3 $\mmi$ as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:dm_dist1}. As the separation of the decay products is predicted to be much larger than the distance where the two clusters are completely separated, the $\DMX$ decay products will be resolved with an efficiency close to 100\%.

\subsection{WCAL optimization}
\label{ch5:sec:new-vismode-setup-wcal}

To boost the signal yield for the $\DMX$ we need to increase its probability of decaying outside the target. We see from Eq.\ref{eq:dm-decay-length} that this number scales linearly on both the nominal energy of the beam the dimension of the dump. In 2018, the energy was already increased to 150 $\gev$ to boost this probability. Additional increase in energy will have several demerit, amounting to a larger background in the sample due to the production mechanism of the beam and a shorter bending that would reduce the rejection power of the SRD. Instead, a new design of the WCAL with short longitudinal dimension can achieve the same purpose while keeping the background under check.

To design the new calorimeter structure, the figure of merit is the signal efficiency, which is defined mostly by the number of $\DMX$ that decay outside the WCAL. This was quantified by a detailed MC-simulation of the setup used to generate the energy spectrum and the decay kinematics of the $\DMX$.

%%% radiation length of tungsten collected at http://pdg.lbl.gov/2014/AtomicNuclearProperties/HTML/tungsten_W.html
In the design used in previous searches, the WCAL had 34 layers in total, each of them consisting of a converter layer made of 3 mm of tungsten and an active part made of a 2 mm plastic scintillators. This sums to a total of $\sim$30X$_0$. Reducing the dimension of the WCAL would impact the radiation length used to contain the main shower and hence change the background conditions. To avoid this, the new design of the calorimeter was studied under the principle that the optimal radiation length should be approximately 30X$_0$. The three following design were considered:

\begin{itemize}
\item An initial part of 9 layers using the original layer structure followed by an additional 25 layers of only tungsten.
\item A calorimeter consisting of 17 layers with layer-structure: 6mm tungsten + 2mm plastic scintillator.
\item A calorimeter consisting of 12 layers with a different structure: 9mm tungsten + 2mm plastic scintillator.
\end{itemize}

In all designs, the initial 5 layers forming the pre-shower part are still used for efficient hadron rejection. Despite its longer length, the first design grants a good energy resolution and a good hermeticity. In the second and third case, the calorimeter is more compact but has a worse energy resolution due to the thicker converter. A sketch of the two last designs is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:wcal-design} and compared to the original one used in the previous searches.

The third design was chosen to be the most suited for our search. The loss in energy resolution has almost no impact on the signal efficiency. The reason is that the short lifetime of the $\DMX$ favors the detection of the ones produced at high energy that are able to escape the dump more efficiently. These $\DMX$ carry most of the initial e$^-$ energy outside of the WCAL in the calorimeter placed downstream (ECAL). Hence, the energy is reconstructed with a precision of $<$1\% regardless of the WCAL structure. The second and third designs are compared to the original WCAL in Table \ref{tab:wcal-length-results}.

\subsubsection{Background and sensitivity}
\label{ch5:sec:background-sensitivity}

A preliminary study of background was performed in this novel setup. As discussed in chapter \ref{chapter3} the main source of background is coming from the production of $\ks$ in the WCAL escaping the dump and decaying in the vacuum tube as the $\DMX$. The decay products can potentially mimic the signal either in the chain K$^0_S \rightarrow \pi^0 \pi^0$ where $\ee$ pair are produced in the $\gamma$ conversion of the photon pair into an $\ee$ or in the rare decays $\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma e^- e^+$. To estimate the impact of such background a simulation of 5$\times 10^6$ $\ks$ was performed using the energy spectrum expected from the production of this particle via electro-nuclear interactions.
The conservative assumption of the simulation is that the $K^0_S$ is produced in an inelastic scattering in the WCAL where all the energy is deposited inside the dump without leaving a significant signature in W2. It was found that only 3\% of the events left a shower separation in the ECAL similar to the one expected from $\DMX$. Less than 1\% of the events are within the acceptance of the trackers. In the majority ($>$90\%) of the surviving events the $\ks$ has an energy $<$60 \gev. This spectrum is significantly different from the one predicted for the $\DMX$, where 95\% of the spectrum is above 100 \gev with a sharp peak at 150 \gev (the nominal beam energy). Finally, no event in the sample was reconstructed with an invariant mass compatible with the $\DMX$, the closest one being reconstructed at 280 MeV. This is well above any $A'$ scenario in the reach of the NA64 experiment \cite{Banerjee:2019hmi}. As the new WCAL design conserves the hermeticity of 30$X_0$, the background coming from $\gamma$-punchtrough is not expected to increase in the new setup. This contribution is hard to study in detail using MC simulation, it was however demonstrated in our previous measurements \cite{Banerjee:2019hmi} that longer setup adds a suppression to this background which is therefore expected to decrease due to the longer decay volume. As both neutral-punchtrough and $\ks$ are not expected to increase, one can conservatively put the background at a level of $0.01<$ (see Table \ref{tab:vis-bkg}).

An analysis based on the simulated data was conducted to estimate the reach of the experiment using the proposed setup. Most of the selection criteria already applied in our previous searches were used for this study. Additionally, a good separation of at least 8 cm is required between the two electromagnetic showers and the reconstructed invariant mass is selected to be within 10\% of the expected $\DMX$ mass. The expected signal yield was computed after all the cuts were applied and used to calculate the 90\% exclusion of different $\DMX$ scenarios. The results of the computation are presented in Fig.\ref{fig:exclusion-x17} that shows the number of EOT necessary to probe a specific $\DMX$ scenario. Assuming a trigger-rate similar to the one observed during 2018 visible-mode data taking, a projection of the days needed is also shown. As expected, the EOTs required to probe a specific $\DMX$ model increases exponentially with the coupling strength $\epsilon$, since the signal yield is dominated by the probability of $\DMX$ to exit the dump. The conclusion is that the complete range $\epsilon < 1.4 \times 10^{-3}$ of $\DMX$ parameter space proposed in \cite{PhysRevD.95.035017} can be covered in approximately 3 months of beam time by accumulating $\sim 7 \times 10^{11}$ EOTs. Models with V$\pm$A coupling mentioned in Sec.\ref{ch1:sec:dm-candidates} on the other hand can be covered faster ($<$10 days) due to the smaller allowed coupling.

A green dashed line shows the maximum $\epsilon$ permitted if $\DMX$ is interpreted as protophobic gauge boson \cite{PhysRevD.95.035017}. The detection efficiency for high $\epsilon$ is dominated by the probability of $\DMX$ to exit the dump as it is shown by the exponential fit (red line). The plot is shown for the two most relevant mass scenarios suggested by the two experiments conducted by the ATOMKI group, i.e. 16.7 MeV (top) and 17.0 MeV (bottom) \cite{Krasznahorkay:2015iga,Krasznahorkay:2019lyl}.}

\section{A new approach: the Muon mode setup}
\label{ch5:sec:muon-mode-setup}

A new approach proposed for the next generation of fixed-target experiments performed by the NA64 collaboration is to use a muon beam to cover a larger region of parameter space \cite{Gninenko:2019qiv}. This search would boost the sensitivity for $\DM$, in particular for a dark mediator mass $m_{\DM} \gtrsim 100 \mev$ as suggested by detail calculation using the ETL cross-section \cite{Gninenko:2019qiv}. Outside of boosting the sensitivity for the $\umodel$, this setup would be sensitive to a dark mediator weakly coupled to muon. One example of such a particle would be a $\DMU$ which interacts predominantly via a $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ current \cite{krasnikov2017muon,GNINENKO2001119}. Alternatively, the $\DMU$ could also be a leptophilic mediator of a dark force between SM and the Dark Sector, charged under U'(1)$_{L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}}$. Other appealing properties of this mediator include a mechanism to account for the observed DM relic abundance \cite{GNINENKO2001119,Kirpichnikov:2020tcf,PhysRevLett.121.011102} and the $\ammu$ anomaly in the case of a muon-specific scalar mediator \cite{krasnikov2017light,PhysRevD.95.115005}.

For this new experiment, the M2 muon beamline will be used to provide 160 \gev muons at a rate of a few 10$^7$ (Muon On Target) MOT per spill. The setup will be placed upstream of the COMPASS experiment, in a space of \SI{13}{\meter}. The case of a muon beam differs significantly from the electron case previously studied. We still use "Dark-Bremsstrahlung" as the primary production channel. we produce the boson using the interaction:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dm-muon-int}
  \mu + Z \to Z + \DMU + \mu
\end{equation}

Because of the higher penetration power of the muon, the interaction can now happen along the full length of the target, and not mainly in the first few radiation lengths as in the case of an electron primary.
For a mass larger than 100 \mev, the expected decay time for this particle is in the order of $\tau_{\DMU} \lesssim 10^{-15} \si{\second}$. Thus, its decay is expected inside the setup shortly after its production. For mass $M_{\DMU} > 2 m_{\mu}$ the branching ratio is evenly shared between the invisible channel $\DMU \to \nu \bar{\nu}$ and the visible channel $\DMU \to \mu^+ \mu^-$. The latter corresponds to a muon-trident signature in the setup and will be left for future searches. The current proposal for NA64 focuses on the invisible channel, hence the signature becomes once again missing momentum. To measure the energy of the $\mu^-$ primary after the interaction, a calorimeter approach is not possible. Instead, a second magnetic spectrometer is placed immediately after the target to measure the momentum a second time. The total energy deposited inside the ECAL must be compatible with the one of a single MIP passing through the detector, to make sure that no energy was lost because of Bremsstrahlung radiation or nuclear interaction. The setup is constructed rearranging the detectors already used in the two other modes. The ECAL is placed immediately after a first magnetic spectrometer (MS1), while the HCAL modules are placed $\sim$6 \si{\meter} downstream after the second spectrometer (MS2) to detect the scattered muon. To reduce background from large nuclear interaction inside the ECAL, the VHCAL modules discussed in Sec.\ref{ch5:sec:new-invismode-setup} is placed after M2 to catch particles emitted at a large angle. A sketch of the proposed setup is illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:muon-mode-setup}.

The experiment also needs an alternative method to reduce the initial trigger rate that does not rely on the energy deposited inside the calorimeters. A new set of scintillator counters is used for this purpose:
\begin{itemize}
\item $S_0$ and $S_1$: Placed before the ECAL and used to characterize the beam.
\item $V_{m1}$,$V_{m1}$,$V_{m3}$,$V_{m4}$: Placed along each MBPL magnets with a width equal to the magnet gap. They are used to reject low energy particles entering the magnets.
\item $S_4$: A scintillator counters shifted 5 \si{\centi\meter} away from the beam axis to trigger on the deflected muon.
\item $V_1$: Placed in front of the beam axis, used to veto the primary beam to avoid a fake trigger of $S_4$ caused by the production of secondaries along the beamline.
\item $S_{\mu}$: Placed at the end of the setup, after the four HCAL modules, and used to tag the scattered muon.
\end{itemize}

The trigger condition will combine all the information of these detectors:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:trigger-mumode}
Tr^{\DMU} = S_0 \times S_1 \times \overline{V_1} \times \overline{V_{m1}}\overline{V_{m2}}\overline{V_{m3}}\overline{V_{m4}}\times S_{\mu}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[bth!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\pdirfive/setup-muon-2021.pdf}
  \caption[Sketch of muon mode setup 2021]{Sketch of muon mode setup 2021. In Green the direction of a muon scattering in the ECAL is shown.}
  \label{fig:muon-mode-setup}
\end{figure}

The selection criteria are chosen to tag only muons that did not have a hard-scattering inside the ECAL. Hence less than 1 $\gev$ energy deposit in the VHCAL and less than 4 $\gev$ energy in each HCAL module. Also, only events with reconstructed momentum compatible with 160 \gev are selected as candidates. Events are binned in the plane (E$_{ECAL}$ + E$_{HCAL}$; p$_{\mu}$), where p$_{\mu}$ is the momentum reconstructed in MS2. The signal region is then defined as p$_{\mu} <$80 $\gev$ and (E$_{ECAL}$+E$_{HCAL}$) $<$ 20 $\gev$. This means that to be selected a muon must have lost at least half of its original energy without any significant energy deposit in any of the calorimeters placed along the beamline.

A detailed MC-simulation was used to test the feasibility of the setup. The beam profile used as input for this simulation was estimated using a dedicated simulation to reproduce faithfully the interaction along the beamline. It was found that the expected background, mostly caused by large scattering neutrals produced in the ECAL, is $\lesssim 10^{-13}$. The setup will be tested in 2021 in the so-called phase 1, where the $\ammu$ parameter space will be probed by accumulating 10$^{11}$ MOT. NA64 plans a second phase after LS3\footnote{Long Shutdown 3 of the LHC}, where $\sim 10^{13}$ MOT will be accumulated to gain sensitivity on the parameter space justifying the observed relic abundance of Dark Matter \cite{Gninenko:2640930}. The projection of sensitivities expected in this second phase, combing results from both electron and muon mode, is illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:dmyplane-mumode}.
