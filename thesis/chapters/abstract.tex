Light Dark Matter models are gaining a growing interest in the scientific community due to their ability of explaining nicely many different observation of the cosmos and at the same time different problems that are still present in out current understanding of particle physics, notably the (g-2)$_{\mu}$ anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. One simple model to probe this new class of dark matter predict the existence The NA64 experiment uses the high energy provided by the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN to test these theories by producing L.
