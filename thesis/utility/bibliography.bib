abstract = "If, during the early Universe epoch, the dark matter particle thermalizes in a hidden sector which does not thermalize with the Standard Model thermal bath, its relativistic thermal decoupling can easily lead to the observed relic density, even if the dark matter particle mass is many orders of magnitude heavier than the usual ∼ eV hot relic mass scale. This straightforward scenario simply requires that the temperature of the hidden sector thermal bath is one to five orders of magnitude cooler than the temperature of the Standard Model thermal bath. In this way the resulting relic density turns out to be determined only by the dark matter mass scale and the ratio of the temperatures of both sectors. In a model independent way we determine that this can work for a dark matter mass all the way from ∼1 keV to ∼30 PeV. We also show how this scenario works explicitly in the framework of two illustrative models. One of them can lead to a PeV neutrino flux from dark matter decay of the order of the one needed to account for the high energy neutrinos observed by IceCube."

abstract = "The main characteristics of the COMPASS experimental setup for physics with hadron beams are described. This setup was designed to perform exclusive measurements of processes with several charged and/or neutral particles in the final state. Making use of a large part of the apparatus that was previously built for spin structure studies with a muon beam, it also features a new target system as well as new or upgraded detectors. The hadron setup is able to operate at the high incident hadron flux available at CERN. It is characterised by large angular and momentum coverages, large and nearly flat acceptances, and good two and three-particle mass resolutions. In 2008 and 2009 it was successfully used with positive and negative hadron beams and with liquid hydrogen and solid nuclear targets. This paper describes the new and upgraded detectors and auxiliary equipment, outlines the reconstruction procedures used, and summarises the general performance of the setup."

Calibration data from the lead glass spectrometer GAMS collected with a wide electron beam without any additional coordinate detector are used. The method may be used for the measurements in both cellular- and projective-type spectrometers. A 10 GeV electron shower profile has been measured in the GAMS spectrometer without optical grease between the lead glass radiators and photomultipliers. The shower profile is parametrized as an analytical function. An estimate of the position accuracy is obtained."

abstract = "The existence of Dark Matter (DM) is a well established fact since many decades, thanks to the observation of the effects of its gravitational interaction with the ordinary matter in the Universe. However, our knowledge of the Dark Matter features is still rather scarce. Indeed, one of the biggest quests in fundamental science today is the investigation of Dark Matter nature, from its origin to its composition, and the way its constituents interact with the ordinary matter, apart from gravity. Huge and ambitious efforts have been spent in the last years into its identification, concentrating especially on the search of viable Weakly Interacting Massive Particle candidates. However, no positive results have been achieved so far along this direction. On the other hand, many fascinating new ideas and models for its interpretation have been blooming: among them, an intriguing hypothesis is that the Dark Matter constituents could be neutral under Standard Model interactions, but they could interact through a new, still unknown, force under a “hidden” charge. This new hidden symmetry would be mediated by a massive gauge boson, the dark photon, which is expected to couple to the Standard Model via a kinetic mixing. The search for such a massive mediator has been pursued with large enthusiasm and dedication in the latest years, as its observation could be within the reach of many already existing experimental facilities, both based on accelerators or in smaller scale setups. This report reviews the present status and progress of the experimental searches in this field."

It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics."

A GEM grid with the electrodes kept at a suitable difference of potential, inserted in a gas detector on the path of drifting electrons, allows to pre-amplify the charge drifting through the channels. Coupled to other devices, multiwire or microstrip chambers, it permits to obtain higher gains, or to operate in less critical conditions. The separation of sensitive and detection volumes offers other advantages: a built-in delay, a strong suppression of photon feedback. Applications are foreseen in high rate tracking and Cherenkov Ring Imaging detectors. Multiple GEM grids assembled in the same gas volume allow to obtain large effective amplification factors in a succession of steps."

abstract = "The light response of a BGO crystal has been measured for particles Z=1–8, A=1–16 in the energy range ∼2–60AMeV. The reaction products are identified by a ΔE(Si)−E(Sci/PD) telescope. The position of the jump in the value of the signal from the PD at the punch-through points is used to calibrate both the ΔE(Si) and E(Sci/PD) scales in MeV. The dependence of the light output on the energy E, ion atomic number Z and mass A is parameterized by the power law relation, L(Z,A,E)=a1(Z,A)Ea2(Z,A). The parameters a1 and a2 have a smooth dependence on Z for all three crystals. The mass dependence of a1,a2 is deduced as a simple analytical expression. The systematics of these parameters is presented for BGO, CsI(Tl) and GSO(Ce) scintillators as a function of Z,A. Calculations of the response function, based on the Murray–Mayer model provide an excellent description of the shape of L(Z,A,E) versus E dependence, but show some deviations in the individual ion normalization constant for the BGO and GSO(Ce) scintillators."
