abstract = "Dark photon (A′) that couples to the standard model fermions via the kinetic mixing with photons and serves as a mediator of dark matter production could be observed in the high-energy electron scattering e−+Z→e−+Z+A′ off nuclei followed by the bremsstrahlung A′→invisible decay. We cross check the exact tree-level calculations of the A′ production cross sections by other results and implement them in the program for the full simulation of such events in the experiment NA64 at the CERN SPS . Using simulations results, we study the missing energy signature for the A′→invisible decay that allows to probe the γ−A′ mixing strength in a wide, from sub-MeV to sub-GeV, A′ mass range. We refine and expand our earlier studies of this signature by including corrections to the previously used calculations based on the improved Weizsaker–Williams (IWW) approximation, which turn out to be significant. We find that the commonly used IWW approach can lead to substantial overestimation of the sensitivity to A′ in fixed target experiments. The possibility of future searches with high-energy electron beams and their sensitivity to A′ are briefly discussed."

abstract = "If, during the early Universe epoch, the dark matter particle thermalizes in a hidden sector which does not thermalize with the Standard Model thermal bath, its relativistic thermal decoupling can easily lead to the observed relic density, even if the dark matter particle mass is many orders of magnitude heavier than the usual ∼ eV hot relic mass scale. This straightforward scenario simply requires that the temperature of the hidden sector thermal bath is one to five orders of magnitude cooler than the temperature of the Standard Model thermal bath. In this way the resulting relic density turns out to be determined only by the dark matter mass scale and the ratio of the temperatures of both sectors. In a model independent way we determine that this can work for a dark matter mass all the way from ∼1 keV to ∼30 PeV. We also show how this scenario works explicitly in the framework of two illustrative models. One of them can lead to a PeV neutrino flux from dark matter decay of the order of the one needed to account for the high energy neutrinos observed by IceCube."

abstract = "The COMPASS experiment makes use of the CERN SPS high-intensity muon and hadron beams for the investigation of the nucleon spin structure and the spectroscopy of hadrons. One or more outgoing particles are detected in coincidence with the incoming muon or hadron. A large polarised target inside a superconducting solenoid is used for the measurements with the muon beam. Outgoing particles are detected by a two-stage, large angle and large momentum range spectrometer. The setup is built using several types of tracking detectors, according to the expected incident rate, required space resolution and the solid angle to be covered. Particle identification is achieved using a RICH counter and both hadron and electromagnetic calorimeters. The setup has been successfully operated from 2002 onwards using a muon beam. Data with a hadron beam were also collected in 2004. This article describes the main features and performances of the spectrometer in 2004; a short summary of the 2006 upgrade is also given."

Although it has eluded discovery or exclusion for three decades, it remains the most compelling solution to the strong-CP problem. Axions may be detected by their resonant conversion to RF photons in a microwave cavity permeated by a magnetic field. Experiments have already set significant limits on the axion's mass and photon coupling; progress in photon detection schemes at or below the standard quantum limit will soon enable definitive searches. Similarly, axions produced in the solar burning core may be detectable by their conversion to X rays in a magnetic helioscope. Significant improvements in both mass range and sensitivity of the axion helioscope will likewise be forthcoming in the next few years. }

Due to the collision of two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component and the fluid-like X-ray-emitting plasma are spatially segregated. By using both wide-field ground-based images and HST/ACS images of the cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps showing that the gravitational potential does not trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic mass component, but rather approximately traces the distribution of galaxies. An 8 σ significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.}

BAOs are detected in the clustering of the combined 2dFGRS and SDSS main galaxy samples, and measure the distance–redshift relation at z= 0.2. BAOs in the clustering of the SDSS luminous red galaxies measure the distance–redshift relation at z= 0.35. The observed scales of the BAOs calculated from these samples and from the combined sample are jointly analysed using estimates of the correlated errors, to constrain the form of the distance measure DV(z) ≡[(1 +z)2D2Acz/H(z)]1/3. Here DA is the angular diameter distance, and H(z) is the Hubble parameter. This gives rs/DV(0.2) = 0.1980 ± 0.0058 and rs/DV(0.35) = 0.1094 ± 0.0033 (1σ errors), with a correlation coefficient of 0.39, where rs is the comoving sound horizon scale at recombination. Matching the BAOs to have the same measured scale at all redshifts then gives DV(0.35)/DV(0.2) = 1.812 ± 0.060. The recovered ratio is roughly consistent with that predicted by the higher redshift Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) supernova data for Λ cold dark matter cosmologies, but does require slightly stronger cosmological acceleration at a low redshift. If we force the cosmological model to be flat with constant w, then we find Ωm= 0.249 ± 0.018 and w=−1.004 ± 0.089 after combining with the SNLS data, and including the WMAP measurement of the apparent acoustic horizon angle in the cosmic microwave background.}",

abstract={The large-scale structure in the distribution of galaxies is thought to arise from the gravitational instability of small fluctuations in the initial density field of the Universe. A key test of this hypothesis is that forming superclusters of galaxies should generate a systematic infall of other galaxies. This would be evident in the pattern of recessional velocities, causing an anisotropy in the inferred spatial clustering of galaxies. Here we report a precise measurement of this clustering, using the redshifts of more than 141,000 galaxies from the two-degree-field (2dF) galaxy redshift survey. We determine the parameter $\beta$ = $\Omega$0.6/b = 0.43 {\textpm} 0.07, where $\Omega$ is the total mass-density parameter of the Universe and b is a measure of the `bias' of the luminous galaxies in the survey. (Bias is the difference between the clustering of visible galaxies and of the total mass, most of which is dark.) Combined with the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background, our results favour a low-density Universe with $\Omega$ ≈ 0.3.},

    abstract = { ▪ Abstract Weak gravitational lensing provides a unique method to map directly the distribution of dark matter in the universe and to measure cosmological parameters. This cosmic-shear technique is based on the measurement of the weak distortions that lensing induces in the shape of background galaxies as photons travel through large-scale structures. This technique is now widely used to measure the mass distribution of galaxy clusters and has recently been detected in random regions of the sky. In this review, we present the theory and observational status of cosmic shear. We describe the principles of weak lensing and the predictions for the shear statistics in favored cosmological models. Next, we review the current measurements of cosmic shear and show how they constrain cosmological parameters. We then describe the prospects offered by upcoming and future cosmic-shear surveys as well as the technical challenges that have to be met for the promises of cosmic shear to be fully realized. }

We illustrate this with explicit examples of WIMPs connected to the Standard Model by metastable bosons or fermions. In all models, provided the WIMP mass is greater than that of the mediator, it can be secluded from the Standard Model with an extremely small elastic scattering cross-section on nuclei and rate for direct collider production. In contrast, indirect signatures from WIMP annihilation are consistent with a weak scale cross-section and provide potentially observable γ-ray signals. We also point out that γ-ray constraints and flavor physics impose severe restrictions on MeV-scale variants of secluded models, and identify limited classes that pass all the observational constraints."

No candidate event was found. In the beam-dump experiment heavy neutrinos have been assumed to be produced by mixing in charmed D meson decays. Neutrinos decaying into e+e−ve, μ+e−vμ, and μ+μ−vμ were searched for. Limits of |Uei|2, |Uμi|2 < 10−7 were obtained for neutrino masses around 1.5 GeV. In the wide-band experiment heavy neutrinos were assumed to be produced by neutral-current neutrino interactions in the CHARM calorimeter. Here a search was made for neutrinos decaying into a μ and hadrons. This experiment is sensitive to decays of neutrinos with mass in the range 0.5–2.8 GeV with limits of |Uμi|2 < 3 × 10−4 for masses around 2.5 GeV. These measurements extend our previous results in the mass range 10–400 MeV."

abstract = "We report on a search for heavy neutrinos (ν4) produced in the decay Ds→τν4 at the SPS proton target followed by the decay ν4→ντe+e− in the NOMAD detector. Both decays are expected to occur if ν4 is a component of ντ. From the analysis of the data collected during the 1996–1998 runs with 4.1×1019 protons on target, a single candidate event consistent with background expectations was found. This allows to derive an upper limit on the mixing strength between the heavy neutrino and the tau neutrino in the ν4 mass range from 10 to 190 MeV. Windows between the SN1987a and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis lower limits and our result are still open for future experimental searches. The results obtained are used to constrain an interpretation of the time anomaly observed in the KARMEN1 detector."

abstract = "Several models of dark matter motivate the concept of hidden sectors consisting of SU(3)C×SU(2)L×U(1)Y singlet fields. The interaction between our and hidden matter could be transmitted by new abelian U′(1) gauge bosons A′ mixing with ordinary photons. If such A′ʼs with the mass in the sub-GeV range exist, they would be produced through mixing with photons emitted in decays of η and η′ neutral mesons generated by the high energy proton beam in a neutrino target. The A′ʼs would then penetrate the downstream shielding and be observed in a neutrino detector via their A′→e+e− decays. Using bounds from the CHARM neutrino experiment at CERN that searched for an excess of e+e− pairs from heavy neutrino decays, the area excluding the γ−A′ mixing range 10−7≲ϵ≲10−4 for the A′ mass region 1≲MA′≲500 MeV is derived. The obtained results are also used to constrain models, where a new gauge boson X interacts with quarks and leptons. New upper limits on the branching ratio as small as Br(η→γX)≲10−14 and Br(η′→γX)≲10−12 are obtained, which are several orders of magnitude more restrictive than the previous bounds from the Crystal Barrel experiment."

The corresponding data have been used for axion and light Higgs particle searches in Refs. [1], [2] before. More recently, limits on dark gauge forces have been derived from this data set, considering a dark photon production from π0-decay [3]. Here we determine extended mass and coupling exclusion bounds for dark gauge bosons ranging to masses mγ′ of 624 MeV at admixture parameters ε≃10−6 considering high-energy Bremsstrahlung of the γ′-boson off the initial proton beam and different detection mechanisms."

This boson, called U, has been searched for in the decay ϕ→ηU, U→e+e−, analyzing the decay η→π0π0π0 in a data sample of 1.7 fb−1. No structures are observed in the e+e− invariant mass distribution over the background. This search is combined with a previous result obtained from the decay η→π+π−π0, increasing the sensitivity. We set an upper limit at 90% C.L. on the ratio between the U boson coupling constant and the fine structure constant of α′/α<1.7×10−5 for 30<MU<400 MeV and α′/α⩽8×10−6 for the sub-region 50<MU<210 MeV. This result assumes the Vector Meson Dominance expectations for the ϕηγ⁎ transition form factor. The dependence of this limit on the transition form factor has also been studied."

An upper limit on the kinetic mixing parameter squared ϵ2 at 90% CL has been obtained for the mass range MU=0.02–0.55 GeV/c2 and is compared with the present world data set. For masses 0.03–0.1 GeV/c2, the limit has been lowered with respect to previous results, allowing now to exclude a large part of the parameter region favored by the muon g−2 anomaly. Furthermore, an improved upper limit on the branching ratio of 2.3×10−6 has been set on the helicity-suppressed direct decay of the eta meson, η→e+e−, at 90% CL."

abstract = "A sample of 1.69×107 fully reconstructed π0→γe+e− decay candidates collected by the NA48/2 experiment at CERN in 2003–2004 is analyzed to search for the dark photon (A′) production in the π0→γA′ decay followed by the prompt A′→e+e− decay. No signal is observed, and an exclusion region in the plane of the dark photon mass mA′ and mixing parameter ε2 is established. The obtained upper limits on ε2 are more stringent than the previous limits in the mass range 9 MeV/c2<mA′<70 MeV/c2. The NA48/2 sensitivity to the dark photon production in the K±→π±A′ decay is also evaluated."

abstract = "The recent interest in a light gauge boson in the framework of an extra U(1) symmetry motivates searches in the mass range below 1 GeV. We present a search for such a particle, the dark photon, in e+e−→Uγ, U→π+π− based on 28 million e+e−→π+π−γ events collected at DAΦNE by the KLOE experiment. The π+ π− production by initial-state radiation compensates for a loss of sensitivity of previous KLOE U→e+e−, μ+μ− searches due to the small branching ratios in the ρ–ω resonance region. We found no evidence for a signal and set a limit at 90% CL on the mixing strength between the photon and the dark photon, ε2, in the U mass range between 527 and 987MeV. Above 700 MeV this new limit is more stringent than previous ones."

abstract = "The existence of Dark Matter (DM) is a well established fact since many decades, thanks to the observation of the effects of its gravitational interaction with the ordinary matter in the Universe. However, our knowledge of the Dark Matter features is still rather scarce. Indeed, one of the biggest quests in fundamental science today is the investigation of Dark Matter nature, from its origin to its composition, and the way its constituents interact with the ordinary matter, apart from gravity. Huge and ambitious efforts have been spent in the last years into its identification, concentrating especially on the search of viable Weakly Interacting Massive Particle candidates. However, no positive results have been achieved so far along this direction. On the other hand, many fascinating new ideas and models for its interpretation have been blooming: among them, an intriguing hypothesis is that the Dark Matter constituents could be neutral under Standard Model interactions, but they could interact through a new, still unknown, force under a “hidden” charge. This new hidden symmetry would be mediated by a massive gauge boson, the dark photon, which is expected to couple to the Standard Model via a kinetic mixing. The search for such a massive mediator has been pursued with large enthusiasm and dedication in the latest years, as its observation could be within the reach of many already existing experimental facilities, both based on accelerators or in smaller scale setups. This report reviews the present status and progress of the experimental searches in this field."

abstract = "We discuss possible extra U(1) gauge symmetries for extensions of the standard model, in connection with their Higgs boson sectors. The more electroweak Higgs doublets, the larger the number of extra U(1) symmetries which may be gauged. For small numbers of Higgs doublets such extra U(1) symmetries usually appear as blind to quark flavor, while this is not necessary for leptons. With only one Higgs doublet any extra U(1) generator must act on quarks and leptons as a linear combination of the baryonic and leptonic numbers B and Li with the weak hypercharge Y. Withtwo or more Higgs doublets they may act as linear combinations of B, Li and Y with axial baryonic and/or leptonic symmetry generators. We also discuss extra U(1) groups in left-right symmetric and grand-unified theories. The corresponding neutral gauge bosons, U, in general mix with the Z bosons, and may be heavy, light, or even remain massless. The strength of the resulting interaction, of unknown range λU = ħ/mUc, is proportional to 1/λU2, and also depends on the extra U(1) symmetry-breaking scale. For very light U bosons this interaction may appear as a deviation from the laws of gravitation (or electromagnetism). After mixing with the Z current the new current is then purely vectorial, in the case of a single Higgs doublet; or it also includes an axial part, which could be responsible for the direct production of U bosons in particle physics experiments, as well as for a new spin-spin force. The vector part of the current is associated with the fifth force charge Q5 = xB + yiLi + zQ, or, in the framework of grand-unified theories: Q5 = x(B − L) + zQ. We discuss, finally, some of the main physical implications of this analysis."

abstract = "Rare leptonic kaon and pion decays K+(π+)→μ+νμe+e− can be used to probe a dark photon of mass O(10) MeV, with the background coming from the mediation of a virtual photon. This is most relevant for the 16.7-MeV dark photon proposed to explain a 6.8σ anomaly recently observed in 8Be transitions by the Atomki Collaboration. We evaluate the reach of future experiments for the dark photon with vectorial couplings to the standard model fermions except for the neutrinos, and show that a great portion of the preferred 16.7-MeV dark photon parameter space can be decisively probed. We also show the use of angular distributions to further distinguish the signal from the background."

The subsequent studies have been focused on possible explanations based on introducing new types of particle. In this work, we improve the nuclear physics modeling of the reaction by studying the pair emission anisotropy and the interferences between different multipoles in an effective field theory inspired framework, and examine their possible relevance to the anomaly. The connection between the previously measured on-shell photon production and the pair production in the same nuclear transitions is established. These improvements, absent in the original experimental analysis, should be included in extracting new particle's properties from the experiment of this type. However, the improvements can not explain the anomaly. We then explore the nuclear transition form factor as a possible origin of the anomaly, and find the required form factor to be unrealistic for the 8Be nucleus. The reduction of the anomaly's significance by simply rescaling our predicted event count is also investigated."

This exceptional result is attributed to a new vector gauge boson X(16.7). We study the significance of this new boson, especially its effect in anomalies observed in long-lasting experimental measurements. By comparing the discrepancies between the Standard Model predictions and the experimental results, we find the values and regions of the couplings of X(16.7) to the muon and muon neutrino. In this work, we find that the newly observed boson X(16.7) may be the solution of both the NuTeV anomaly and the (g − 2)

    abstract = { Within the framework of the Bhabha–Madhavarao formalism, a consistent approach to the derivation of a system of the fourth-order wave equations for the description of a spin-3 2 particle is suggested. For this purpose an additional algebraic object, the so-called q-commutator (q is a primitive fourth root of unity) and a new set of matrices ημ, instead of the original matrices βμ of the Bhabha–Madhavarao algebra, are introduced. It is shown that in terms of the ημ matrices we have succeeded in reducing a procedure of the construction of fourth root of the fourth-order wave operator to a few simple algebraic transformations and to some operation of the passage to the limit z → q, where z is some (complex) deformation parameter entering into the definition of the η-matrices. In addition, a set of the matrices 𝒫1/2 and 𝒫3/2(±)(q) possessing the properties of projectors is introduced. These operators project the matrices ημ onto the spins 1/2- and 3/2-sectors in the theory under consideration. A corresponding generalization of the obtained results to the case of the interaction with an external electromagnetic field introduced through the minimal coupling scheme is carried out. The application to the problem of construction of the path integral representation in para-superspace for the propagator of a massive spin-3 2 particle in a background gauge field within the Bhabha–Madhavarao approach is discussed. }

abstract={Considering that the proton is a basic subatomic component of all ordinary matter --- as well as being ubiquitous in its solo role as the hydrogen ion H+ --- there are some surprising gaps in our knowledge of its structure and behaviour. A collaborative project to determine the root-mean-square charge radius of the proton to better than the 1{\%} accuracy of the current 'best' value suggests that those knowledge gaps may be greater than was thought. The new determination comes from a technically challenging spectroscopic experiment --- the measurement of the Lamb shift (the energy difference between a specific pair of energy states) in 'muonic hydrogen', an exotic atom in which the electron is replaced by its heavier twin, the muon. The result is unexpected: a charge radius about 4{\%} smaller than the previous value. The discrepancy remains unexplained. Possible implications are that the value of the most accurately determined fundamental constant, the Rydberg constant, will need to be revised --- or that the validity of quantum electrodynamics theory is called into question.},

We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on High Energy Soft QCD and Diffraction and one on the Determination of CKM Angles from B Hadrons.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 98 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 22 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal.

abstract = "There has been much activity in the measurement of the elastic electromagnetic proton and neutron form factors in the last decade, and the quality of the data has been greatly improved by performing double-polarization experiments, in comparison with previous unpolarized data. Here we review the experimental data base in view of the new results for the proton, and neutron, obtained at MIT-Bates, MAMI, and JLab. The rapid evolution of phenomenological models triggered by these high-precision experiments will be discussed, including the recent progress in the determination of the valence quark generalized parton distributions of the nucleon, as well as to the steady rate of improvements made in the lattice QCD calculations.",

	abstract = {The fine-structure constant, α, is a dimensionless constant that characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between charged elementary particles. Related by four fundamental constants, a precise determination of α allows for a test of the Standard Model of particle physics. Parker et al. used matter-wave interferometry with a cloud of cesium atoms to make the most accurate measurement of α to date. Determining the value of α to an accuracy of better than 1 part per billion provides an independent method for testing the accuracy of quantum electrodynamics and the Standard Model. It may also enable searches of the so-called {\textquotedblleft}dark sector{\textquotedblright} for explanations of dark matter.Science, this issue p. 191Measurements of the fine-structure constant α require methods from across subfields and are thus powerful tests of the consistency of theory and experiment in physics. Using the recoil frequency of cesium-133 atoms in a matter-wave interferometer, we recorded the most accurate measurement of the fine-structure constant to date: α = 1/137.035999046(27) at 2.0 {\texttimes} 10-10 accuracy. Using multiphoton interactions (Bragg diffraction and Bloch oscillations), we demonstrate the largest phase (12 million radians) of any Ramsey-Bord{\'e} interferometer and control systematic effects at a level of 0.12 part per billion. Comparison with Penning trap measurements of the electron gyromagnetic anomaly ge - 2 via the Standard Model of particle physics is now limited by the uncertainty in ge - 2; a 2.5σ tension rejects dark photons as the reason for the unexplained part of the muon{\textquoteright}s magnetic moment at a 99\% confidence level. Implications for dark-sector candidates and electron substructure may be a sign of physics beyond the Standard Model that warrants further investigation.},

abstract = "The latest generation of Micromegas detectors show a good energy resolution, spatial resolution and low threshold, which make them idoneous in low energy applications. Two micromegas detectors have been built for dark matter experiments: CAST, which uses a dipole magnet to convert axion into detectable x-ray photons, and MIMAC, which aims to reconstruct the tracks of low energy nuclear recoils in a mixture of CF4 and CHF3. These readouts have been respectively built with the microbulk and bulk techniques, which show different gain, electron transmission and energy resolutions. The detectors and the operation conditions will be described in detail as well as their discrimination capabilities for low energy photons will be discussed."

abstract = "We present and discuss a set of systematic measurements, carried out with gaseous proportional micro-pattern detectors, in order to assess their maximum gain when irradiated with high-rate soft X-rays and heavily ionizing alpha particles. The inventory of detectors tested includes: micro-strips, micromegas, micro-dot, gas electron multiplier, CAT (compteur à trous), trench (or groove), micro-CAT (or WELL) detectors, as well as systems with two elements of gaseous amplification in cascade. We confirm the general trend of all single-stage detectors to follow Raether's criterion, i.e. a spontaneous transition from avalanche to streamer, followed by a discharge, when the avalanche size reaches a value of a few 107; a noticeable exception is the micro-dot counter holding more than 108. In multiple structures, where the gain is shared between two devices in cascade, the maximum overall gain under irradiation is increased by at least one order of magnitude; we speculate this to be a consequence of a voltage dependence of Raether's limit, larger for low operating potentials. Our conclusion is that only multiple devices can guarantee a sufficient margin of reliability for operation in harsh LHC running conditions."

Tests have demonstrated that the origin of discharges in hadron beams is mainly associated with nuclear interactions of the incident particle with the gas of the detector. Use of low average Z gas mixtures diminishes the spark rate. The streamer discharge model of Raether has been proved to be valid for this detector. A detector polarization which minimizes the spark energy is proposed. Gas and geometry factors improving the discharge limit are discussed."

abstract = "We introduce the gas electrons multiplier (GEM), a composite grid consisting of two metal layers separated by a thin insulator, etched with a regular matrix of open channels. A GEM grid with the electrodes kept at a suitable difference of potential, inserted in a gas detector on the path of drifting electrons, allows to pre-amplify the charge drifting through the channels. Coupled to other devices, multiwire or microstrip chambers, it permits to obtain higher gains, or to operate in less critical conditions. The separation of sensitive and detection volumes offers other advantages: a built-in delay, a strong suppression of photon feedback. Applications are foreseen in high rate tracking and Cherenkov Ring Imaging detectors. Multiple GEM grids assembled in the same gas volume allow to obtain large effective amplification factors in a succession of steps."

The position of the jump in the value of the signal from the PD at the punch-through points is used to calibrate both the ΔE(Si) and E(Sci/PD) scales in MeV. The dependence of the light output on the energy E, ion atomic number Z and mass A is parameterized by the power law relation, L(Z,A,E)=a1(Z,A)Ea2(Z,A). The parameters a1 and a2 have a smooth dependence on Z for all three crystals. The mass dependence of a1,a2 is deduced as a simple analytical expression. The systematics of these parameters is presented for BGO, CsI(Tl) and GSO(Ce) scintillators as a function of Z,A. Calculations of the response function, based on the Murray–Mayer model provide an excellent description of the shape of L(Z,A,E) versus E dependence, but show some deviations in the individual ion normalization constant for the BGO and GSO(Ce) scintillators."

The effects of systematic uncertainty in the signal and background models are incorporated in the confidence levels. The procedure described allows efficient computation of expected confidence levels."

The most well-known use of this framework is for the combined search for the Higgs boson at LEP. A toy neutrino oscillations experiment is used to illustrate the rich information available in the framework for exclusion and discovery. I argue that the so-called CLs technique for setting limits is appropriate for determining exclusion intervals while the determination of confidence intervals advocated by Feldman and Cousins' method is more appropriate for treating established signals, i.e. going beyond discovery to measurement.
